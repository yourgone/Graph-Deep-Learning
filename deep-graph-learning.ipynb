These architectures are different from the previous notebooks owing to the fact that these use first and second order proximity to determine the node representations. The first order proximity suggests that nodes can be related based on adjacency and the second order suggests that nodes are characterised based on the neighbourhood of the nodes.Both the papers associated with the embeddings are present here:\n\n- [SDNE](https://paperswithcode.com/method/sdne)\n- [LINE](https://paperswithcode.com/method/line)\n\nThese are very high order embeddings and used for capturing representations on exclusively large networks. These are scalable representations which are based on regressed adjacency properties and laplacian maps.\n\n<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DPJSagrX0AAYdSy.jpg\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install networkx\n!pip install gensim\n!pip install torch\n!pip install tensorflow","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-11T11:28:26.625956Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-11T11:28:26.626336Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-11T11:28:50.426814Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-11T11:28:26.626304Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-11T11:28:50.425799Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## SDNE (Structural Deep Network Embeddings)\n\n<img src=\"https://www.programmersought.com/images/979/223a8a8bc9b82f9255018d248c355c8b.png\">\n\n### SDNE algorithm principle\n\n#### Similarity definition\n\nThe definition of similarity in SDNE is the same as LINE. Simply put, the first-order similarity measures the similarity between two adjacent vertex pairs. The second-order similarity measures the similarity of the neighbor sets of two vertices.\n\n#### 2nd order similarity optimization goal\n\n``` L2nd​=∑i=1n​∣∣x^i​−xi​∣∣22​```\n\nHere we use the adjacency matrix of the graph for input. For the i-th vertex, we have x_i=s_i xi​=si​,Every s_i si​Both contain the neighbor structure information of vertex i, so this reconstruction process can make vertices with similar structures have similar embedding representation vectors.\n\nOne problem here is that due to the sparseness of the graph, the number of non-zero elements in the adjacency matrix S is far fewer than zero elements, so for the neural network as long as all output 0 can achieve a good effect, this is not ours want.\n\nOne method given in the article is to use a weighted loss function, which has a higher penalty coefficient for non-zero elements.\n\n1st order similarity optimization goal\nCapture Reconstruction loss of the predicted and true values\n\n2nd order similarity optimization goal\nUse the trace of the laplacian matrix and normalize the results\n\nThe loss function can make the embedding vectors corresponding to two adjacent vertices in the graph close in the hidden space.\n\n\nWhere L is the Laplacian matrix corresponding to the graph, L = D-S L=D−S, D is the degree matrix of the vertices in the graph, and S is the adjacency matrix.\n\n\nOverall optimization goal\nThe loss function of joint optimization is\n```Lmix​=L2nd​+αL1st​+νLreg​```\n\nL_{reg} Lreg​Is the regularization term, \nalpha αTo control the parameters of the first-order loss\n\n\nThe second order proximity is preserved by passing the adjacency matrix of te graph through an unsupervised autoencoder which has a built in reconstruction loss function it must minimize.\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/proxy/1*44eDEuZBEsmG_TCAKRI3Kw@2x.png\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df=pd.read_csv('../input/google-quest-challenge/train.csv')\ntrain_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-16T19:04:15.420573Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-16T19:04:15.420882Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-16T19:04:15.762443Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-16T19:04:15.420853Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-16T19:04:15.761485Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"execution_count":3,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"   qa_id                                     question_title  \\\n0      0  What am I losing when using extension tubes in...   \n1      1  What is the distinction between a city and a s...   \n2      2  Maximum protusion length for through-hole comp...   \n3      3              Can an affidavit be used in Beit Din?   \n4      5       How do you make a binary image in Photoshop?   \n\n                                       question_body question_user_name  \\\n0  After playing around with macro photography on...               ysap   \n1  I am trying to understand what kinds of places...      russellpierce   \n2  I'm working on a PCB that has through-hole com...

The problems with the techniques I used is that focus is manual and aperture control is problematic at best. This limited my setup to still subjects (read: dead insects) Now, as spring is approaching, I want to be able to shoot live insects. I believe that for this, autofocus and settable aperture will be of great help.\n\nSo, one obvious but expensive option is a macro lens (say, EF 100mm Macro) However, I am not really interested in yet another prime lens. An alternative is the electrical extension tubes.\n\nExcept for maximum focusing distance, what am I losing when using tubes (coupled with a fine lens, say EF70-200/2.8) instead of a macro lens?\n # of connections: 1","LIFE_ARTS # of connections: 1","I am trying to understand what kinds of places the spam values on p 231 refer to in the 5th Edition main book for Shadowrun.\n\nPer p 15, a sprawl is a plex, a plex is a \"metropolitan complex, short for metroplex\".

It isn't so much to in it in or prove a point as it is to understand the concept better. Anyways this is his response after I showed him this thread.

If you have a signal in time domain and ...take the FT, I get a signal which DOES NOT HAVE to be in frequency domain. Clarify this to the guy who posted last. Now the new signal is in a domain defined by me and so is its units. This signal although not equal to the original signal, still represents that if ya take an inverse FT.

The following passage in the introduction intrigued me:\n\n\n  Each compactification leads to a different vacuum state.... at least one state should describe our Universe in its entirety.... the enormous number (~10^500 at last count) of solutions, with no perturbative mechanism to select mechanism to select among them, leads some critics to question the predictive power of the theory..Even more worrying is that, while the theory is perturbatively finite order by order, the perturbation series does not seem to converge.\n\n\nI don't know anything about string theory and so I could not make head or tails this. All I know is that ~$10^{500}$    is a very large number. \n\n\nWhat exactly is a 'solution' in string theory? Is it a spacetime metric of some sort or the terms of a S-matrix of some sort?  \nWhy are there so many 'solutions'? \nI thought string theory was supposed to be finite, why do perturbative series still diverge?\nIs there any experimental technique to limit the number of 'solutions'?  \nWill experimental techniques be able to pinpoint a solution within present day string theorists' lifetimes too? If not, how long will it take before we can experimentally probe these things? \nAre string theorists completely relaxed about these issues? Or are they in anguish? \n\n # of connections: 1","I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.\nSince I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.\n\n\nDead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. \nIf you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  \nDigital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.\nRulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. \nEven better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. \n\n\nI think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.\n\nSo what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. \n\nIs this just a necessary part of earning money?

That was a big mistake. Now every time I go on the server I crash. \n\nI don't have access to the server files and I don't have the owner's email or phone number or anything and I'm the only one that plays on the server.

(Since potential energy is relative, we have an infinite number of potential functions.)\n\nNotice that the gradient of the potential function is the negative of the force field: $$\\nabla U = \\nabla(mgy + C) = mg \\,\\mathbf{j} = -\\mathbf{F}.$$\n\nThat was perfectly fine with me. But now in vector calculus, I am reading that the potential function $f$ of a vector function $\\mathbf{F}$ is such that $\\nabla f = \\mathbf{F}$. A negative sign appears to have been lost when migrating from physics to calculus.\n\nIt seems confusing to call $f$ a \"potential function\", since it cannot be interpreted as potential energy in the real world. So why is the calculus nomenclature as it is (i.e., why not call this something else and then say the potential function is the negative of it)?\n # of connections: 1","It came up in Dresden Files, but is not limited to that game, you can find the term in DnD as well.

One of the answers suggest that a feature is actually an epic.  \n\nSo are features and epics considered the same thing, which is basically a collection of related user stories?\n\nOur project manager insists that there's a hierarchical structure:\n\nEpic -> Features -> User stories\n\n... basically all user stories must fall within this structure.  Therefore all user stories must fall under an umbrella feature and all features must fall under an epic.\n\nTo me, that sounds awkward.

I've always assumed that anything other than standard TC-treated plastic or glass would significantly increase background, but perhaps my views on background fluorescence are a little outdated. Does anybody have experience with these in a fluorescent microscopy/high-throughput screening environment?\n\nSpecifically in my case, I'm looking at endocytosis and trafficking of a labeled protein into the lysosome. I'm labeling the protein with the pH-dependent dye pHrodoTM from Molecular Probes, which supposedly has very little fluorescence at neutral pH, but becomes very bright as the pH drops when endocytic vesicles become lysosomes. This theoretically means that a final wash step is not needed, but with a matrix coating on the plates I'm worried about background.\n\nSo, what is the current thinking as far as background fluorescence of the various TC matrices is concerned? Does the background come from the matrix itself, or by the fluorescent dye becoming adsorbed to it? Is it wavelength-dependent? Fortunately I may not be stuck with my poorly-adhering cells, and I may not need supplemental matrix at all in the end, but I still want a better understanding of how it works.\n # of connections: 1","I'm working on a client's site and I noticed that posts have a hidden &lt;div&gt; filled to SPAM links to dick pills, etc. Hoping to get lucky, I searched for some of the keywords in the database tables, but found no matches.

Each person goes to the supermarket 100 times in a year and buys 10 of the 1000 items that the supermarket sells. We believe that a pair of criminals will buy exactly the same set of 10 items at some time during the year. If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals? Assume our hypothesis to be that a pair of criminals will surely buy a set of 10 items in common at some time during the year. \n\n\nThis is meant to be an illustration of Bonferroni's principle. Suppose there are no criminals and that everyone behaves at random. Would we find any pairs of people who appear to be criminals?\n\nWe must initially find the expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year. I'm not sure whether I do this correctly...\n\nHere is how I've been going about solving it:\n\nNumber of possible pairs of people: $\\binom{10^6}{2} = \\frac{10^{12}}{2} = 5 \\times 10^{11}$, using the fact that $\\binom{n}{2} \\approx \\frac{n^2}{2}$, when $n$ is large.\n\nNumber of possible 10-item selections: $\\binom{10^3}{10} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^{23}$\n\nProbability of a customer buying 10 particular items at a point in time:\n$\\frac{1}{2.6 \\times 10^{23}}$\n\nProbability of a customer buying 10 particular items at least once over the course of 100 periods in time: $\\frac{100}{2.6 \\times 10^{23}}$\n\nProbability of a pair buying exactly the same 10 items (both at least once) over the course of 100 periods in time: $(\\frac{100}{2.6 \\times 10^{23}})^2 = (\\frac{1}{2.6 \\times 10^{21}})^2 = \\frac{1}{6.76 \\times 10^{42}}$\n\nThe expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year is thus:\n\n$ 5 \\times 10^{11} \\times \\frac{1}{6.76 \\times 10^{42}} = \\frac{5}{6.75 \\times 10^{31}}$\n\nBecause the above number is so low if we do find a pair buying the same 10 items then, under our hypothesis, they are likely to be criminals and not a false positive case. \n\nI am just wondering whether my solution to the above is correct?\n # of connections: 1","I will like to know the formula for calculating the minimum sample size required for a comparative study involving 2 groups with unequal size.

One thing that makes this conversion a little bit tricky, is the existence of a breaker box at the rear corner of the room.\n\nAs you can see in the image below, we plan to have the back 5' of the room become a storage area (there would be 2' deep shelving units along the back wall, stopping short of the breaker box, we would use this area to store Christmas decorations, misc. stuff, etc..).  I know it is illegal to place a breaker box in a closet that will store clothes or other combustibles.

Our system tracks the serial numbers that the user can access. We have considered three possible input modes:\n\n1. We show the user the entire list of serial numbers they can access and allow him to select one from the list (like how a select element would work on an HTML page).\n\nPros:\n\n\nThe user doesn't have to type anything in.\nThe user can't enter an invalid serial number.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nThe list is likely to be overwhelmingly large.\nThe serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.\nData usage for downloading the entire list of serial numbers\n\n\n2. We allow the user to start entering the serial number in a text input and have an auto-suggest drop-down with a filtered list of serial numbers the user can access.\n\nPros:\n\n\nThe user doesn't have to type in a complete serial number.\nThe user is unlikely to enter an invalid serial number.\nSmaller list to choose from than Option 1.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nThe serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.\nAuto-suggest may have limited value since the unit has a barcode that we could read.\nData usage for downloading a sizable list of serial numbers\n\n\n3. We require the entire serial number to be entered, and once we recognize the correct number of characters, we validate the serial number against the user's accessible list and show feedback.\n\nPros:\n\n\nThe unit has a barcode that we could read, so this has the potential to be simpler than an auto-suggest or select-from-list paradigm.\nSimpler implementation\nSignificantly reduced data usage vs. Option 1 and Option 2\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nThe unit has multiple barcodes, so it might take a couple of tries for the user to capture the correct one.\nTyping manually would be tedious if the camera is unavailable or barcode scanner isn't working for whatever reason (lighting, etc.)\n\n\nWhich of these three is the best approach?

Curtis' time rewind is a power of huge significance, but it's not controlled by the beginning of the second season either. Therefore the system must support uncontrolled and unreliable powers.\nThe system you recommend must support regular humans as significant combat threats - Sally gave Simon a real fight.

It seemed to be relying on security through obscurity as far as protecting it. But as we know, it ended up not being so secure because it wasn't so obscure - Harry Potter knew about the Room of Hidden Things.\n\nMy question is, the way Rowling describes this hints at the fact that Riddle had an assumption that very few people would ever stumble upon that room. *WHY???\n\n\n\nFirst, let's show Harry's theory on what Voldemort was thinking, how and why:\n\nHere's Harry understanding Voldemort's thinking in HP7 once he figured out where the Diadem was (bold emphasis mine):\n\n\n  Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant\n  enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of\n  Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never\n  set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his\n  time at school – here at least was a secret area he and Voldemort knew, that\n  Dumbledore had never discovered –\n\n\n...and later on, with Harry explains the location to Ron/Hermione:\n\n\n  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.”\n  \n  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.\n  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nYet, from available evidence, that seems to be a completely wrong assumption, even at Voldemort's time. \n\nLet's examine that last quote again, with emphasis on other info available:\n\n\n  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries.” ...\n  \n  ...\n  \n  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.\n  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in\n  my time... this way,” he added. “I think it’s down here... “ \n  \n  They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’ footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats...\n\n\n.\n\nOK, so if there's a truckload (or train-load, by the description) of stuff in that room, isn't the only reasonable conclusion: \"the room is a fairly popular destination with plenty of people who've found their way there in the past, and therefore, likely, plenty who will in the future\"? \n\nDoesn't matter what your arrogance level is, the evidence seems to point to only one conclusion - it's quite fine as a place to temporarily bury your dirt so teachers won't tag you for your misdeeds, but this is NOT the place to hide something that you want permanently safe! \n\nSo why did Voldemort make such a moronic mistake?\n # of connections: 1","How do I hide my javascript/jquery scripts from html page  (from view source on right click)? please give suggestion to achive this .\n\nThanks.\n # of connections: 1","My application has a toolbar and a lot of buttons on it.

Like many new cars coming out these days, it has \"Start &amp; Stop\" technology that turns the engine off when the car is stationary and is put in neutral and the clutch is released. When putting down the clutch again the engine fires back up.\n\nMy question then is this: \n\na) Is start-stop technology bad for my engine in any way? \n\nb) What impact might start-stop have on my battery? I.e. won't it deteriorate battery life with the constant turning on and off? (The radio, fans and lights remain on whilst in \"stop\"-mode, but not things like the aircon.)\n\nc) Will this technology really benefit me that much with regards to fuel-consumption? I can imagine it will be more economic when stops in heavy traffic become really long or traffic lights are red for long periods, but for the most part when driving the car doesn't turn off for longer than a minute at most before I have to \"start\" it up again.\n\nAs many new cars lately have this technology I imagine that it can't be that bad, but I'm curious as to it's actual real benefits.

Applying the DFT to an image and taking the inverse DFT of the spectrum yields the original image, so this works.

I use a 3x3 averaging kernel and pad it with zeroes to the same size as the input image. I then take the DFT of it, and do a piecewise multiplication of the image spectrum and the kernel spectrum. \n\nThe inverse DFT of the resulting spectrum yields an interesting result: The image is filtered (smoothed) correctly, however the quadrants are swapped. Interestingly, if I filter it twice (or any even number), the quadrants are properly arranged.

But I often get confused.\n\nFor instance:\n\n  int x = 15; // Stored as binary as is?  00000000 00000000 00000000 00001111?\n  int y = -22; // Stored as two complemented value? 11111111 11111111 11111111 11101010\n\n\nEdit\n\nTo be clear, x = 15 \n\n   In binary as is: `00000000 00000000 00000000 00001111'\n  Two's complement: `11111111 11111111 11111111 11110001`\n\n\nSo if your answer is  all numbers are stored as two's complement then:\n\n  int x = 15; // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11110001\n  int y = -22 // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11101010\n\n\nThe confusion here again is the sign says, both are negative numbers. May be I am misreading / misunderstanding it?\n\nEdit\nNot sure my question is confusing. Forced to isolate the question:\n\nMy question precisely: Are positive numbers stored in binary as is while negative numbers are stored as two's complement?\n\nSome said all are stored in two's complement and one answer says only negative numbers are stored as two's complement.\n # of connections: 1","Suppose that I have made bread dough and it is supposed to be degassed around 90 min after kneading (t+90). Suppose that I have to leave home at t+30 and will be back sometime between t+120 and t+150. \n\nWhat is better for the dough, to degas it too early or to degas it too late? I know I can try to influence the duration of the first rising by changing the temperature (I could either put it in the fridge or in an oven preheated to 50°C, turned off and cracked open). But I doubt that the dough's internal temperature will change substantially during these short times. \n\nSo, what is the better strategy? Warm it and degas early, or cool it and degas late? \n\nFor the record, I am talking about a high-hydration bread (86%), with sugar, but no fat, 2.8% yeast. But if the hydration, leanness and yeast amount have an influence on the decision, I would like to hear about that too.

If we use a choice function to construct a mathematical object, the object will often depend on the specific choice function being used. So constructions that require the axiom of choice often do not provide the existence of a unique object with certain properties. In some cases they do, however. The existence of a cardinal number for every set (ordinal that can be mapped bijectively onto the set) is such an example.\n\n\n  What are natural examples outside of\n  set theory where the existence of a\n  unique mathematical object with\n  certain properties can only be proven\n  with the axiom of choice and where the\n  uniqueness itself can be proven in ZFC (I\n  don't want the uniqueness to depend on\n  a specific model of ZFC)? \n\n\nThe next question is a bit more vague, but I would be interested in some kind of birds-eye view on the issue.\n\n\n  Are there some general guidelines to understand in which cases the axiom of choice can be  used to construct a provably unique object with certain properties?\n\n\nThis question is motivated by a discussion of uniqueness-properties of certain measure theoretic constructions in mathematical economics that make heavy use of non-standard analysis. \n\nEdit: Examples so far can be classified in three categories: \n\nCardinal Invariants: One uses the axiom of choice to construct a representation by some ordinal. Since ordinals are canonically well ordered, this gives us a unique, definable object with the wanted properties. Example: One takes the dimension (as a cardianl) of a vector space and constructs the vector space as functions on finite subsets of the cardinal (François G. Dorais).\n\nAC Properties: One constructs the object canonically \"by hand\" and then uses the axiom of choice to show that it has a certain property. Trivial example:  $2^\\mathbb{R}$ as the family of well-orderable sets of reals.\n\nEmploying all choice functions: Here one gets uniqueness by requiring the object to contain in some sense all objects of a certain kind that can be obtained by AC. Examples: The Stone-Čech compactification as the set of all ultrafilters on it (Juris Steprans), or the dual space of a vector space, the space of all linear functionals. (Martin Brandenburg) The AC is used to show that these spaces are rich enough.

The longest I've seen was 720 days going back. I suspect they do store everything, but intentionally limit access.\n\nThese transactions are text only, take up extremely little space, and storing an individual's lifetime worth of transaction would take less than 10MB of data; about the storage required by two MP3 files, and about 250k records per person per lifetime, if we generously assume everyone makes 10 transactions a day. But I'd be happy with only the last 10 years of transactions, so about 1MB per customer. One of the largest banks, JP Morgan Chase, has ~70MM credit card customers. That means 70TB of data for 10 years of records - hardly impressive for a corporation of that size, with $17B of net income in 2013, when 1TB of cloud storage costs $10 retail per month.\n\nBy comparison, would you put up with Gmail or any online email provider keeping only the most recent 120 days worth of email? (And emails do take a lot more space than transactions, are far more numerous, and have to be instantly retrievable.)\n\nStorage requirements for transaction activity are trivial in an era where we're throwing around petabytes and zetabytes.\n\nIs there a sound reason for banks not offering access to all your transactions, other than legacy software on their side?\n\n\n\n\n # of connections: 1","I want to build a managed packaged and ultimately deploy it on the AppExchange.

Based on my experiences with John The Ripper, I doubt that repeating a pattern in a password would shorten the time to successfully brute force a password like f00B@rf00B@rf00B@r as opposed to a random string of equal length. However, my doubt is based on the fact that, according to the documentation, JTR does not include a specific attack mode for repeating patterns. JTR, and presumably other brute force tools, can be customized for any arbitrary attack mode. But we can't know how often attackers bother to customize attacks in this way. So then the question becomes mathematical. Please forgive the awkward pseudo mathematical notation. \n\nT = brute force cracking time\n\nPL = pattern of characters of length L\n\nN = number of times PL is repeated\n\nR(LN) = string of random characters of length (L times N)\n\n\nWould it be true that\n\nT(PL*N)= T(R(LN))\n\n\nIf true, then a repeating pattern password would not affect brute force cracking time. But is it true?\n # of connections: 1","I have a site that I am migrating to WordPress, and I have a need to add properties that each of the users can edit (e.g., Address, City, State, Business Name, etc), along with some properties that Administrators can edit (IsActive, CanEmail) that wouldn't be displayed to the user.

Superman says to Lois that he used to play the game as a kid and that he never was very good at it. With whom did he play that would have had those powers? He came to Earth as an infant. Furthermore I don't buy that he was simply talking about hide and seek or some Earthly game. His statement that he was never good at it would not have made sense in that context. \n # of connections: 1","Let's take a wire or a rope. I usually do this with a chain or my scarf.\n\nI fixate one end in my hand and apply rotation (by subtle movements of this endpoint like spinning a lasso). The rope gets into rotation and obtains certain bent shape:\n\n\nSome part is missing because cellphone cameras ain't great for high-speed photos but I hope you can imagine all the scarf.\n\nThe question is: how can I calculate/predict this shape?\n\nAlthough this problem doesn't seem that bizarre, I have never seen any solution. Nor I have found this question asked anywhere on internet... Must be because I just don't know how to formulate it without pictures.\n\nAlso by taking longer rope I get more than one bend:\n\n\nI apoligize for the quality again.

On your next turn, you gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for each attack that you refrained from making against the same opponent. You gain this bonus only against an opponent that you refrained from making an attack of opportunity against in the previous round.\n\n\nI am wondering if this feat is really that good. It seems that it requires a huge investment (in terms of feats) and it is unclear to me whether it really pays off.\n\nThe bonuses +4 AR/dmg per refrained AoO (which you have an infinite supply of (*)) do seem interesting, at first, however:\n\n\nA prerequisite of Stormguard Warrior is Ironheart Aura, which in itself does not seem that interesting, especially for a Crusader (Thicket of Blade is not an Ironheart stance)\nThe bonuses gained can only be used against the opponent that generated them, and no other (it's a minor restriction, but worth keeping in mind)\nAn AoO is likely to do much more damage than 4, especially if using a two-handed weapon (even at level 1, we are looking at 1d10 + 6 ~= 11.5)\n\n\nThus, the two feats investment seems only worth it if one can generate more AoOs than one has available. In the recommendations I have seen, it is combined with Robilar's Gambit (-4 AR, 1 AoO per foe attack in melee) which itself requires Combat Reflexes. Dexterity is unlikely to be ignored (since it benefits Touch AC), and therefore we are looking at a minimum of 3 or 4 available AoOs per round...\n\nLetting Combat Reflexes and Robilar's Gambit aside, is it really worth it investing in Ironheart Aura and Stormguard Warrior? Am I missing something?\n\n(*) I have seen some debates where it is argued that refraining to take an AoO to fuel up Channel the Storm should use it up, which I ignore here. The feat is much worse in this case.\n # of connections: 1","Which of the following is more appropriate / polite?\n\nI would like to bring a couple of facts (or things?) to your notice.\nOR\nI would like to let you know a couple of facts.\n\nPlease advise.\n # of connections: 1","Here are some common definitions from a dictionary for ‘literal’:\n\n\nBeing in accordance with, conforming to, or upholding the exact or primary meaning of a word or words.\nWord for word; verbatim: a literal translation.\nAvoiding exaggeration, metaphor, or embellishment; factual; prosaic: a literal description; a literal mind.\n\n\nSo what does it mean then to ‘take the Bible literally?’ Which definition are we referring to when we say ‘I take the Bible literally?’\n # of connections: 1","My company is in a small town and there are not any graphic designers but we have enough business in the town and the surrounding area to support us.

So here is my problem.  \n\nI created a sign that has an oval with scrolls and flowers in different colors on a field of turquoise.  The client did not want to spend the money on a logo design so I said that I will  just retain the rights so that she would have to come to me for the approval to use the logo on anything else.

Apparently this company did for much less and you can tell by the quality.\n\nBut here is my problem.  She had a jpeg that I allowed her to have so she could create her own fliers and I was ok with that since it would not have made me much if any money.  Well I am looking at the sign that the other person did and all that was done is they made a longer oval since this sign is more rectangle and used a different font.  And put this over the design that I did.  To me this is copyright infringement since the client did not want to buy all the rights.  But who do I address?

When I bought it, it was wrapped in plastic, had been stored in the shop's stock house for about 20 years and free of corrosion.\n\nI'm about 95 kilos, thread quite hard but rides exclusive to paved bike paths. The original, 20(?) year-old wheel lasted me a year with no problems. The front wheel is still fine and true. \n\nSpokes breaking - and getting replaced\n\nAfter a little under a year, I suddenly noticed that a few spokes had broken. On closer inspection, quite a few were too loose. Should have noticed sooner but didn't.\n\nI took it to a shop, where they advised me to have the wheel rebuilt which I paid them to do. The gearing being internal, the new rims and spokes were built on the existing hub.\n\nAfter just two weeks, the back wheel suddenly began to feel wobbly on my way to work. As careful as I could, I drove the bike back to the shop. Almost all spokes were terribly loose.\n\nThey retensioned the wheel free of charge (of course) and sent me on my way. The following weeks, I periodically checked that all spokes were still tensioned.\n\n2,5 months later, I noticed three of the spokes were broken close to the hub. Went back to the shop and had the spokes replaced (free or charge). 1 month later I noticed 2 broken spokes and had those replaced as well. They seemed less eager to keep fixing the wheel free of charge, and when I asked why the spokes kept breaking, the guy muttered something about the hub holes maybe had burrs due to wear.\n\nNow, a few weeks later, I find another spoke broken.\n\nMy gut tells me this all stems from a bad build, that quickly lost tension and thus damaged the spokes. I find the explanation about a worn hub a bit far fetched, but I don't have the knowledge to dismiss the theory.\n\nQuestions\n\nIs there any way this is not the shop's fault? - A bad build? Cheap spokes? Improperly tensioned?\n\nGiven the wheel's history, is there any point in keep replacing spokes, a couple at a time, or should I get the wheel rebuilt (preferably at the shop's expense)?\n\nCould the hub in any way be to blame for this?\n\nThank you!\n\nUpdate Oct 24th\n\nI've been trying to get in touch with the manager of the shop throughout the week. Failed again to reach him this morning, so I figured I'd have a chat about my problem with one of the guys on the floor.\n\nTried to get him to provide at least a theory of why my spokes keep breaking, but not much came out of it really. He mentioned that he've seen, on rare occasaions, that a worn hub could cut the spokes (could be the same guy as I spoke to last time).\n\nI'll check the hubs as soon as possible, as @Daniel R Hicks suggested. Due to plumbing work in our appartment, I haven't been home or able to check my bike all week.\n\nIf I don't see any indicatations that the spokes were put in the wrong way, I'm going to follow the advice most of you have, and take my bike to another shop for advice and repair.\n\nThanks so far! - I'll update you after I've payed the other shop a visit.\n\nUpdate Nov 3rd\n\nTook the bike to the other shop, told them the story. Let them decide to replace the broken spoke or them all.\n\nThey decided to replace just the broken spoke with a DT spoke (what ever that means). They also trued the wheel, which had gotten a slight \"eggy\" shape.\n\nMy fingers are crossed that this wheel will last now.\n\nOnce again, thank you all for your input!\n\nAnecdotal Update\n\nIn case anyone follows... Since the last repair at the other shop, the wheel kept being in good shape. Finally, my spokes stayed tensioned, wheels stiff and true - the long struggle was finally over. Alas, the joy didn't even last a month...\n\nGoing home from a company party, I returned to my bike I parked at the train station, only to find out that some punk kids had apparently tossed it to the ground, and jumped both wheels badly out of shape. Front wheel had to be replaced and back wheel was in desperate need for a trueing. sigh\n\nSorry for the melodrama, just thought I'd update you the faith of my bike ;-).\n # of connections: 1","I have been experiencing a slow draining of the battery for the past 1-2 months wherein the vehicle will be fine and suddenly the vehicle will not start.  \n\nFirst thought was the battery, as the vehicle has about 90000 on it.  I could have tested it, but didn't; just bought another one thinking it would save the trouble soon enough if it wasn't the battery.  On installing the battery, I checked for the usual: lights left on, doors left open, etc.  But there was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nTwo weeks later, the new battery drained. I charged up the old one swapped it in.  One week later, that one was drained.  \n\nDetermined now that it was not the battery, I searched high and low for some good tests.  I did a ground test (all less than 2-1ohm), point to point resistance check(all 1-2ohm), parasitic draw test (30mA after entering sleep mode), and charging voltage test.  Everything looked satisfactory.  The only thing that I noticed was, if I left the nominal voltage charging test run, for minutes, I would slowly watch the voltage creep down.  After twenty minutes I was seeing 13.8V after starting at 14.3V (measured across the battery terminals).  I ran out of time to swap out the battery on my multimeter (thinking this might be the culprit), so it could just be that.  But, I'm curious.  Does a slow fall of the charging voltage (across the battery terminals) indicate an alternator problem?  Belt tensioner problem?

In essence, the analogy stated that God is like fire. Different objects, when dropped into the fire, react differently. Some become hard. Some become soft. Some let off smoke. Some change their hue. Some make a noise. Some might explode. But while all of these different reactions can be found, at no stage is the fire anything other than a fire; the difference in responses to it is to be found in the different objects that come into contact with it.\n\nSo too, the analogy concluded, when it comes to our relationship with God. When we pray, we change ourselves in order that God might interact more favourably with us. We do not hope for God to change in any way, but for ourselves to change instead. God's influence upon the world is constant and unchanging; it is we who are in flux.\n\nDoes this analogy sound familiar to anybody?

Someone mentioned that he guessed the correct number five times in a row, and said that this was surprising because the probability of this happening was $$\\left(\\frac{1}{38}\\right)^5$$\n\nThis is true if you only play the game $5$ times. However, if you play it more than $5$ times there's a higher (should be much higher?) probability that you'll get $5$ in a row at some point. \n\nI was thinking about how surprised this person should be at their streak of $m$ correct guesses given that they play $n$ games, each with probability $p$ of success. It makes intuitive sense that their surprise should be proportional to $1/q$ (or maybe $\\log(1/q)$ since $1$ in a billion doesn't surprise you $10$ times more than $1$ in $100$ million), where $q$ is the probability that they get at least one streak of $m$ correct guesses at some point in their $n$ games. \n\nSo, with the Roulette example I was thinking about, $p=1/38$ and $m=5$. \n\nI tried to find an explicit formula for $q$ in terms of $n$, and encountered some difficulty, because of the non-independence of \"getting a streak in the first five tries\" and \"getting a streak in tries $2$ through $6$\" (if the first is a failure, it's much more  likely that the second will be too). \n\n\n\nIn summary, two questions:\n\n\nHow do I find the probability that you get $5$ correct guesses in a row at some point if you play $n$ games of Roulette?\nMore generally, what is the probability that you get $m$ successes at some point in a series of $n$ events, each with probability $p$ of success? \n\n\nThe variables satisfy $\\,\\,\\,m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $\\,\\,\\,m\\leq n$, $\\,\\,\\,p \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $\\,\\,\\,0 \\leq p \\leq 1$.\n\n\n\nIf we write the answer to the second question as a function $q(m,n,p)$, then we can say that $q$ should be increasing with $n$, decreasing with $m$, and increasing with $p$. It should equal $p^n$ when $m=n$ and should equal $1$ when $p=1$ and $0$ when $p=0$. \n\nI feel as though this should be a basic probability problem, but I'm having trouble solving it. Maybe some kind of recursive approach would work?

I tried to prove it by using induction on the structure of $A$. If $A$ is a formula and $V$ is a model that gives $f$ to all atomic formulas then $V(A) = f$. The base case is $A = p$ and so $V(A) = f$. We assume that it holds for the formulas $B$ and $C$. We have $A = xor(B,C)$ and by using the induction hypothesis and the definition of $xor$ we get $V(A) = f$.\n\nBut I want to show that we cannot create the function $\\land$ I tried using the same method as before but it doesn't seem to work.

Is this true at least for $\\beta$ algebraic integer?\n\nEdit 2: This question came up when trying to solve this problem of mine.\n\n\n\nAll I know so far is that if $\\beta$ is a Pisot integer, i.e. if it is a real algebraic integer greater than $1$ with every conjugate lying in the unit circle, then $\\alpha \\in \\Bbb{Q}(\\beta)$ if and only if it has an ultimately periodic expansion (which is stronger than my question).\n # of connections: 1","One of my concerns before purchasing a car is how expensive repairs are going to be down the road. For example my car up until recently was a Volvo 850, and the air conditioner didn't work in it; the cost of getting it fixed was significantly higher than other cars because of the way the A/C unit is installed in the car, so I went on without air conditioning. Another example is the service light in the car - while the car had a standard OBD-II port which could read error messages, it required a special Volvo reader to reset the service light.\n\nI know a lot of generalizations can be made about one make versus another, but those are obviously not allowed on this site (in fact, I hope this question is allowed at all...) - so that's not what I'm looking for. And I know there is a wide range of problems a car can encounter, and many of them are universal - replacing tires, for (a bad) example.\n\nSo, just like I can go to KBB and look up the recommended price of a car, is there someplace I can go to look up a make &amp; model of a car and see what proprietary, extra-expensive parts are in the car? Something that, for example, I could have put in the Volvo 850 and it would have told me about those above-mentioned peculiarities alongside undoubtedly a number of other proprietary bits that I didn't have problems with.\n # of connections: 1","I am trying to do a very basic thing, which I though I should be able to manage all on my own, but alas.. \n\nWhat I am attempting to do, is to get hold of the values returned by \"df -h\", and to be able to store these values in a bash script array.

Most of my projects contain few (20 or less) images, so I just display them in full size and let the visitor scroll (example) because this is how I prefer to browse other artist's work as well.\n\nFor projects containing more images, I use thumbnails which link to the full-sized images, because, again, when I browse other artist's portfolios, if there are lots of images on a page it's kinda cumbersome to load. \n\nRecently I wrote some jQuery to implement a lightbox effect (modal window overlay) so when you click on a thumbnail, the full-sized image appears (example).\n\nMy main reasons for implementing this:\n\n\nit's much more presentable than having a direct link to the image,\nwhich is what I used to do\nif the visitor shares the image on something like tumblr or\nPinterest, the link back will be to the project page instead of a\ndirect link to the image\nif the visitor wants to right-click on the thumbnails to load several\nimages in several new browser tabs/windows, they can still do so (the\nlightbox is triggered on left click)\n\n\nI did not include a close button because it seems like more work for the visitor to have to look for a close button, than to simply click anywhere to close the lightbox (which is what I did).\n\nWhat are your thoughts regarding lightbox interface for this particular use?\nThe goal would be the best way to showcase visual art/design work, and the target audience would be, well, anyone who wants to view the work.

At this point, I simply want to disable the samsung calendar app from displaying any sort of notifications (since the google app also displays notifications and I want to use that app).\n\nI have been able to do this by going to settings->Notifications in the samsung app and toggling to \"Off\".\n\nHowever, as soon as I restart the device, the notifications are back on their original settings. Anyone else experience this? Anyone know how to make the settings stick?\n\nEDIT: I notice the notification settings of the google developed app (sound, default reminder time, popup) are also not sticking after reboot. Is my device broken? It seems to only be for calendar. Gmail and other apps hold their settings fine.\n\nEDIT 2: Ok, so disabling the samsung app allows my google app calendar settings to stick after reboot. So looks like that is what I will be doing.

He has a hint to use triplets of rationals that bound each simple discontinuity on the left, right, and in between the values of the limits from the left and right. It seems like this can be weakened to just rationals to the left and right. \n\nSimple discontinuities are those in which the limit from the left and right exist, so there must be intervals to the left and right of a simple continuity on which no other simple discontinuity can exist. More precisely, let $c$ and $c'$ be simple discontinuities for $f$ on $(a,b)$ and consider the limit, $l$, of $f$ approaching $c$ from the left:\n\n$\\forall \\epsilon &gt;0, \\exists \\delta&gt;0 : c-x&lt;\\delta \\Rightarrow |l-f(x)|&lt;\\epsilon$\n\nbut $ \\exists \\epsilon '&gt;0 \\forall \\delta ' &gt;0 : |c'-x|&lt;\\delta ' \\Rightarrow |f(c')-f(x)|&gt;\\epsilon '\n\\\\ \\therefore \\epsilon = \\epsilon ' , \\delta ' = \\delta \\rightarrow \\leftarrow\n$\n\nTherefore, you can make an injection from the set of simple discontinuities to a subset of rationals by associating each simple discontinuity with one rational in the aforementioned \"free\" interval to its left; from there compose with the map from rationals to integers to show countable.

The wiki page on RP has more information when needed. Typically, the process from diagnosis of RP to (near) complete loss of eye sight takes years to decades.\n\nHowever, Chebat et al. (2007) make mention that their study group, consisting of congenitally blind subjects, includes one person with RP (see table 1 in the linked article). Hence, this implicates that this particular subject was blind from birth due to effects of RP. \n\nIs anyone familiar with newborns blinded by the effects of RP?\n\n\nReference\nChebat et al.

I did some research and some people suggest to use CLR and some suggest to the business logic in C# code. I haven't done this system before and I want to know how other people do it.\n\nWhat I have in my mind is to create a Queue table and and triggers for the tables I want to watch for changes. When the trigger is executed, it will insert an email request to the Queue table. Later, I will loop that queue table and send emails. I might be using Amazon web services to send emails in near future but not decided yet.\n\nDo you think this is a good idea?\n # of connections: 1","I'm trying to create a dynamic library in Rust that exports a struct as a symbol that will be loaded into a C program via dlopen().\n\nHowever, I'm was running into some segfaults when accessing the second string in the struct, so I made a small test program to try figure out what I'm doing wrong.\n\nThis is the Rust code (test.rs), compiled with \"rustc --crate-type dylib test.rs\":\n\n#[repr(C)]\npub struct PluginDesc {\n    name: &amp;'static str,\n    version: &amp;'static str,\n    description: &amp;'static str\n}\n\n\n#[no_mangle]\npub static PLUGIN_DESC: PluginDesc = PluginDesc {\n    name: \"Test Plugin\\0\",\n    version: \"1.0\\0\",\n    description: \"Test Rust Plugin\\0\"\n};\n\n\nand here is the C program that attempts to load the library (test.c), compiled with \"gcc test.c -ldl -o test\":\n\n#include &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\n\ntypedef struct {\n    const char *name;\n    const char *version;\n    const char *description;\n} plugin_desc;\n\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\n    void *handle;\n    plugin_desc *desc;\n\n    handle = dlopen(\"./libtest.so\", RTLD_LOCAL | RTLD_LAZY);\n    if (!handle) {\n        printf(\"failed to dlopen: %s\\n\", dlerror());\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    desc = (plugin_desc *) dlsym(handle, \"PLUGIN_DESC\");\n    if (!desc) {\n        printf(\"failed to dlsym: %s\\n\", dlerror());\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"name: %p\\n\", desc-&gt;name);\n    printf(\"version: %p\\n\", desc-&gt;version);\n    printf(\"description: %p\\n\", desc-&gt;description);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nThis is the output:\n\nname: 0x7fa59ef8d750\nversion: 0xc\ndescription: 0x7fa59ef8d75c\n\n\nAs you can see, the address of desc->version is actually 0xc (12), which is the length of the first string. So it looks like the struct that gets packed into the library also contains the string length after the memory address.\n\nAm I using the wrong string type here? As you can see I had to also make the strings NULL terminated manually.

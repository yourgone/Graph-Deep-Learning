These architectures are different from the previous notebooks owing to the fact that these use first and second order proximity to determine the node representations. The first order proximity suggests that nodes can be related based on adjacency and the second order suggests that nodes are characterised based on the neighbourhood of the nodes.Both the papers associated with the embeddings are present here:\n\n- [SDNE](https://paperswithcode.com/method/sdne)\n- [LINE](https://paperswithcode.com/method/line)\n\nThese are very high order embeddings and used for capturing representations on exclusively large networks. These are scalable representations which are based on regressed adjacency properties and laplacian maps.\n\n<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DPJSagrX0AAYdSy.jpg\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install networkx\n!pip install gensim\n!pip install torch\n!pip install tensorflow","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-11T11:28:26.625956Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-11T11:28:26.626336Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-11T11:28:50.426814Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-11T11:28:26.626304Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-11T11:28:50.425799Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## SDNE (Structural Deep Network Embeddings)\n\n<img src=\"https://www.programmersought.com/images/979/223a8a8bc9b82f9255018d248c355c8b.png\">\n\n### SDNE algorithm principle\n\n#### Similarity definition\n\nThe definition of similarity in SDNE is the same as LINE. Simply put, the first-order similarity measures the similarity between two adjacent vertex pairs. The second-order similarity measures the similarity of the neighbor sets of two vertices.\n\n#### 2nd order similarity optimization goal\n\n``` L2nd​=∑i=1n​∣∣x^i​−xi​∣∣22​```\n\nHere we use the adjacency matrix of the graph for input. For the i-th vertex, we have x_i=s_i xi​=si​,Every s_i si​Both contain the neighbor structure information of vertex i, so this reconstruction process can make vertices with similar structures have similar embedding representation vectors.\n\nOne problem here is that due to the sparseness of the graph, the number of non-zero elements in the adjacency matrix S is far fewer than zero elements, so for the neural network as long as all output 0 can achieve a good effect, this is not ours want.\n\nOne method given in the article is to use a weighted loss function, which has a higher penalty coefficient for non-zero elements.\n\n1st order similarity optimization goal\nCapture Reconstruction loss of the predicted and true values\n\n2nd order similarity optimization goal\nUse the trace of the laplacian matrix and normalize the results\n\nThe loss function can make the embedding vectors corresponding to two adjacent vertices in the graph close in the hidden space.\n\n\nWhere L is the Laplacian matrix corresponding to the graph, L = D-S L=D−S, D is the degree matrix of the vertices in the graph, and S is the adjacency matrix.\n\n\nOverall optimization goal\nThe loss function of joint optimization is\n```Lmix​=L2nd​+αL1st​+νLreg​```\n\nL_{reg} Lreg​Is the regularization term, \nalpha αTo control the parameters of the first-order loss\n\n\nThe second order proximity is preserved by passing the adjacency matrix of te graph through an unsupervised autoencoder which has a built in reconstruction loss function it must minimize.\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/proxy/1*44eDEuZBEsmG_TCAKRI3Kw@2x.png\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df=pd.read_csv('../input/google-quest-challenge/train.csv')\ntrain_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-16T19:04:15.420573Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-16T19:04:15.420882Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-16T19:04:15.762443Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-16T19:04:15.420853Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-16T19:04:15.761485Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"execution_count":3,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"   qa_id                                     question_title  \\\n0      0  What am I losing when using extension tubes in...   \n1      1  What is the distinction between a city and a s...   \n2      2  Maximum protusion length for through-hole comp...   \n3      3              Can an affidavit be used in Beit Din?   \n4      5       How do you make a binary image in Photoshop?   \n\n                                       question_body question_user_name  \\\n0  After playing around with macro photography on...               ysap   \n1  I am trying to understand what kinds of places...      russellpierce   \n2  I'm working on a PCB that has through-hole com...

The problems with the techniques I used is that focus is manual and aperture control is problematic at best. This limited my setup to still subjects (read: dead insects) Now, as spring is approaching, I want to be able to shoot live insects. I believe that for this, autofocus and settable aperture will be of great help.\n\nSo, one obvious but expensive option is a macro lens (say, EF 100mm Macro) However, I am not really interested in yet another prime lens. An alternative is the electrical extension tubes.\n\nExcept for maximum focusing distance, what am I losing when using tubes (coupled with a fine lens, say EF70-200/2.8) instead of a macro lens?\n # of connections: 1","LIFE_ARTS # of connections: 1","I am trying to understand what kinds of places the spam values on p 231 refer to in the 5th Edition main book for Shadowrun.\n\nPer p 15, a sprawl is a plex, a plex is a \"metropolitan complex, short for metroplex\".

It isn't so much to in it in or prove a point as it is to understand the concept better. Anyways this is his response after I showed him this thread.

If you have a signal in time domain and ...take the FT, I get a signal which DOES NOT HAVE to be in frequency domain. Clarify this to the guy who posted last. Now the new signal is in a domain defined by me and so is its units. This signal although not equal to the original signal, still represents that if ya take an inverse FT.

The following passage in the introduction intrigued me:\n\n\n  Each compactification leads to a different vacuum state.... at least one state should describe our Universe in its entirety.... the enormous number (~10^500 at last count) of solutions, with no perturbative mechanism to select mechanism to select among them, leads some critics to question the predictive power of the theory..Even more worrying is that, while the theory is perturbatively finite order by order, the perturbation series does not seem to converge.\n\n\nI don't know anything about string theory and so I could not make head or tails this. All I know is that ~$10^{500}$    is a very large number. \n\n\nWhat exactly is a 'solution' in string theory? Is it a spacetime metric of some sort or the terms of a S-matrix of some sort?  \nWhy are there so many 'solutions'? \nI thought string theory was supposed to be finite, why do perturbative series still diverge?\nIs there any experimental technique to limit the number of 'solutions'?  \nWill experimental techniques be able to pinpoint a solution within present day string theorists' lifetimes too? If not, how long will it take before we can experimentally probe these things? \nAre string theorists completely relaxed about these issues? Or are they in anguish? \n\n # of connections: 1","I have seen this question about updates of the D&amp;D 4th Edition books, and it got me thinking.\nSince I got my Kindle I have not read a single paper novel; they have fewer drawbacks compared to digital copies than rpg rulebooks.\n\n\nDead-tree types have some benefits like looking good on a bookshelf, but any ebook reader weighs less with 100 novels than the usual hard-cover book. \nIf you want to look for the damage of Ares Alpha, even with a half-decent tablet it takes less than 2 seconds.  \nDigital copies do not get worn, they never get unwanted earmarks, but you can bookmark them.\nRulebooks do get updates, and unless you are willing to take a pen to your book, your hard copies will never contain them. The pdfs can be edited and resent to the buyers. \nEven better is the WotC approach with the DDI, you can look up any monster or item or (almost any) rule, in the most recent form, for 3 years at the cost of seven books. \n\n\nI think this is the way to go, even considering the horribly slow character builder. Although I must admit good illustration can help build the athmosphere.\n\nSo what am I missing? Why are people buying rpg rulebooks in paper format? Why are books even published, I do not need to know if feats are supposed to be on the right page and skills on the left, I just want a list of them, filterable any way I want. \n\nIs this just a necessary part of earning money?

That was a big mistake. Now every time I go on the server I crash. \n\nI don't have access to the server files and I don't have the owner's email or phone number or anything and I'm the only one that plays on the server.

(Since potential energy is relative, we have an infinite number of potential functions.)\n\nNotice that the gradient of the potential function is the negative of the force field: $$\\nabla U = \\nabla(mgy + C) = mg \\,\\mathbf{j} = -\\mathbf{F}.$$\n\nThat was perfectly fine with me. But now in vector calculus, I am reading that the potential function $f$ of a vector function $\\mathbf{F}$ is such that $\\nabla f = \\mathbf{F}$. A negative sign appears to have been lost when migrating from physics to calculus.\n\nIt seems confusing to call $f$ a \"potential function\", since it cannot be interpreted as potential energy in the real world. So why is the calculus nomenclature as it is (i.e., why not call this something else and then say the potential function is the negative of it)?\n # of connections: 1","It came up in Dresden Files, but is not limited to that game, you can find the term in DnD as well.

One of the answers suggest that a feature is actually an epic.  \n\nSo are features and epics considered the same thing, which is basically a collection of related user stories?\n\nOur project manager insists that there's a hierarchical structure:\n\nEpic -> Features -> User stories\n\n... basically all user stories must fall within this structure.  Therefore all user stories must fall under an umbrella feature and all features must fall under an epic.\n\nTo me, that sounds awkward.

I've always assumed that anything other than standard TC-treated plastic or glass would significantly increase background, but perhaps my views on background fluorescence are a little outdated. Does anybody have experience with these in a fluorescent microscopy/high-throughput screening environment?\n\nSpecifically in my case, I'm looking at endocytosis and trafficking of a labeled protein into the lysosome. I'm labeling the protein with the pH-dependent dye pHrodoTM from Molecular Probes, which supposedly has very little fluorescence at neutral pH, but becomes very bright as the pH drops when endocytic vesicles become lysosomes. This theoretically means that a final wash step is not needed, but with a matrix coating on the plates I'm worried about background.\n\nSo, what is the current thinking as far as background fluorescence of the various TC matrices is concerned? Does the background come from the matrix itself, or by the fluorescent dye becoming adsorbed to it? Is it wavelength-dependent? Fortunately I may not be stuck with my poorly-adhering cells, and I may not need supplemental matrix at all in the end, but I still want a better understanding of how it works.\n # of connections: 1","I'm working on a client's site and I noticed that posts have a hidden &lt;div&gt; filled to SPAM links to dick pills, etc. Hoping to get lucky, I searched for some of the keywords in the database tables, but found no matches.

Each person goes to the supermarket 100 times in a year and buys 10 of the 1000 items that the supermarket sells. We believe that a pair of criminals will buy exactly the same set of 10 items at some time during the year. If we search for pairs of people who have bought the same set of items, would we expect that any such people found were truly criminals? Assume our hypothesis to be that a pair of criminals will surely buy a set of 10 items in common at some time during the year. \n\n\nThis is meant to be an illustration of Bonferroni's principle. Suppose there are no criminals and that everyone behaves at random. Would we find any pairs of people who appear to be criminals?\n\nWe must initially find the expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year. I'm not sure whether I do this correctly...\n\nHere is how I've been going about solving it:\n\nNumber of possible pairs of people: $\\binom{10^6}{2} = \\frac{10^{12}}{2} = 5 \\times 10^{11}$, using the fact that $\\binom{n}{2} \\approx \\frac{n^2}{2}$, when $n$ is large.\n\nNumber of possible 10-item selections: $\\binom{10^3}{10} \\approx 2.6 \\times 10^{23}$\n\nProbability of a customer buying 10 particular items at a point in time:\n$\\frac{1}{2.6 \\times 10^{23}}$\n\nProbability of a customer buying 10 particular items at least once over the course of 100 periods in time: $\\frac{100}{2.6 \\times 10^{23}}$\n\nProbability of a pair buying exactly the same 10 items (both at least once) over the course of 100 periods in time: $(\\frac{100}{2.6 \\times 10^{23}})^2 = (\\frac{1}{2.6 \\times 10^{21}})^2 = \\frac{1}{6.76 \\times 10^{42}}$\n\nThe expected number of pairs who buy the same 10 items per year is thus:\n\n$ 5 \\times 10^{11} \\times \\frac{1}{6.76 \\times 10^{42}} = \\frac{5}{6.75 \\times 10^{31}}$\n\nBecause the above number is so low if we do find a pair buying the same 10 items then, under our hypothesis, they are likely to be criminals and not a false positive case. \n\nI am just wondering whether my solution to the above is correct?\n # of connections: 1","I will like to know the formula for calculating the minimum sample size required for a comparative study involving 2 groups with unequal size.

One thing that makes this conversion a little bit tricky, is the existence of a breaker box at the rear corner of the room.\n\nAs you can see in the image below, we plan to have the back 5' of the room become a storage area (there would be 2' deep shelving units along the back wall, stopping short of the breaker box, we would use this area to store Christmas decorations, misc. stuff, etc..).  I know it is illegal to place a breaker box in a closet that will store clothes or other combustibles.

Our system tracks the serial numbers that the user can access. We have considered three possible input modes:\n\n1. We show the user the entire list of serial numbers they can access and allow him to select one from the list (like how a select element would work on an HTML page).\n\nPros:\n\n\nThe user doesn't have to type anything in.\nThe user can't enter an invalid serial number.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nThe list is likely to be overwhelmingly large.\nThe serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.\nData usage for downloading the entire list of serial numbers\n\n\n2. We allow the user to start entering the serial number in a text input and have an auto-suggest drop-down with a filtered list of serial numbers the user can access.\n\nPros:\n\n\nThe user doesn't have to type in a complete serial number.\nThe user is unlikely to enter an invalid serial number.\nSmaller list to choose from than Option 1.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nThe serial numbers usually have the same format and are often sequential, so it might be hard to read the list.\nAuto-suggest may have limited value since the unit has a barcode that we could read.\nData usage for downloading a sizable list of serial numbers\n\n\n3. We require the entire serial number to be entered, and once we recognize the correct number of characters, we validate the serial number against the user's accessible list and show feedback.\n\nPros:\n\n\nThe unit has a barcode that we could read, so this has the potential to be simpler than an auto-suggest or select-from-list paradigm.\nSimpler implementation\nSignificantly reduced data usage vs. Option 1 and Option 2\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nThe unit has multiple barcodes, so it might take a couple of tries for the user to capture the correct one.\nTyping manually would be tedious if the camera is unavailable or barcode scanner isn't working for whatever reason (lighting, etc.)\n\n\nWhich of these three is the best approach?

Curtis' time rewind is a power of huge significance, but it's not controlled by the beginning of the second season either. Therefore the system must support uncontrolled and unreliable powers.\nThe system you recommend must support regular humans as significant combat threats - Sally gave Simon a real fight.

It seemed to be relying on security through obscurity as far as protecting it. But as we know, it ended up not being so secure because it wasn't so obscure - Harry Potter knew about the Room of Hidden Things.\n\nMy question is, the way Rowling describes this hints at the fact that Riddle had an assumption that very few people would ever stumble upon that room. *WHY???\n\n\n\nFirst, let's show Harry's theory on what Voldemort was thinking, how and why:\n\nHere's Harry understanding Voldemort's thinking in HP7 once he figured out where the Diadem was (bold emphasis mine):\n\n\n  Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant\n  enough to assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of\n  Hogwarts Castle. Of course, Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never\n  set foot in that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his\n  time at school – here at least was a secret area he and Voldemort knew, that\n  Dumbledore had never discovered –\n\n\n...and later on, with Harry explains the location to Ron/Hermione:\n\n\n  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.”\n  \n  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.\n  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry.\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nYet, from available evidence, that seems to be a completely wrong assumption, even at Voldemort's time. \n\nLet's examine that last quote again, with emphasis on other info available:\n\n\n  “He hid it exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries.” ...\n  \n  ...\n  \n  “And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence.\n  “He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him I’ve had to hide stuff in\n  my time... this way,” he added. “I think it’s down here... “ \n  \n  They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’ footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats...\n\n\n.\n\nOK, so if there's a truckload (or train-load, by the description) of stuff in that room, isn't the only reasonable conclusion: \"the room is a fairly popular destination with plenty of people who've found their way there in the past, and therefore, likely, plenty who will in the future\"? \n\nDoesn't matter what your arrogance level is, the evidence seems to point to only one conclusion - it's quite fine as a place to temporarily bury your dirt so teachers won't tag you for your misdeeds, but this is NOT the place to hide something that you want permanently safe! \n\nSo why did Voldemort make such a moronic mistake?\n # of connections: 1","How do I hide my javascript/jquery scripts from html page  (from view source on right click)? please give suggestion to achive this .\n\nThanks.\n # of connections: 1","My application has a toolbar and a lot of buttons on it.

Like many new cars coming out these days, it has \"Start &amp; Stop\" technology that turns the engine off when the car is stationary and is put in neutral and the clutch is released. When putting down the clutch again the engine fires back up.\n\nMy question then is this: \n\na) Is start-stop technology bad for my engine in any way? \n\nb) What impact might start-stop have on my battery? I.e. won't it deteriorate battery life with the constant turning on and off? (The radio, fans and lights remain on whilst in \"stop\"-mode, but not things like the aircon.)\n\nc) Will this technology really benefit me that much with regards to fuel-consumption? I can imagine it will be more economic when stops in heavy traffic become really long or traffic lights are red for long periods, but for the most part when driving the car doesn't turn off for longer than a minute at most before I have to \"start\" it up again.\n\nAs many new cars lately have this technology I imagine that it can't be that bad, but I'm curious as to it's actual real benefits.

Applying the DFT to an image and taking the inverse DFT of the spectrum yields the original image, so this works.

I use a 3x3 averaging kernel and pad it with zeroes to the same size as the input image. I then take the DFT of it, and do a piecewise multiplication of the image spectrum and the kernel spectrum. \n\nThe inverse DFT of the resulting spectrum yields an interesting result: The image is filtered (smoothed) correctly, however the quadrants are swapped. Interestingly, if I filter it twice (or any even number), the quadrants are properly arranged.

But I often get confused.\n\nFor instance:\n\n  int x = 15; // Stored as binary as is?  00000000 00000000 00000000 00001111?\n  int y = -22; // Stored as two complemented value? 11111111 11111111 11111111 11101010\n\n\nEdit\n\nTo be clear, x = 15 \n\n   In binary as is: `00000000 00000000 00000000 00001111'\n  Two's complement: `11111111 11111111 11111111 11110001`\n\n\nSo if your answer is  all numbers are stored as two's complement then:\n\n  int x = 15; // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11110001\n  int y = -22 // 11111111 11111111 11111111 11101010\n\n\nThe confusion here again is the sign says, both are negative numbers. May be I am misreading / misunderstanding it?\n\nEdit\nNot sure my question is confusing. Forced to isolate the question:\n\nMy question precisely: Are positive numbers stored in binary as is while negative numbers are stored as two's complement?\n\nSome said all are stored in two's complement and one answer says only negative numbers are stored as two's complement.\n # of connections: 1","Suppose that I have made bread dough and it is supposed to be degassed around 90 min after kneading (t+90). Suppose that I have to leave home at t+30 and will be back sometime between t+120 and t+150. \n\nWhat is better for the dough, to degas it too early or to degas it too late? I know I can try to influence the duration of the first rising by changing the temperature (I could either put it in the fridge or in an oven preheated to 50°C, turned off and cracked open). But I doubt that the dough's internal temperature will change substantially during these short times. \n\nSo, what is the better strategy? Warm it and degas early, or cool it and degas late? \n\nFor the record, I am talking about a high-hydration bread (86%), with sugar, but no fat, 2.8% yeast. But if the hydration, leanness and yeast amount have an influence on the decision, I would like to hear about that too.

If we use a choice function to construct a mathematical object, the object will often depend on the specific choice function being used. So constructions that require the axiom of choice often do not provide the existence of a unique object with certain properties. In some cases they do, however. The existence of a cardinal number for every set (ordinal that can be mapped bijectively onto the set) is such an example.\n\n\n  What are natural examples outside of\n  set theory where the existence of a\n  unique mathematical object with\n  certain properties can only be proven\n  with the axiom of choice and where the\n  uniqueness itself can be proven in ZFC (I\n  don't want the uniqueness to depend on\n  a specific model of ZFC)? \n\n\nThe next question is a bit more vague, but I would be interested in some kind of birds-eye view on the issue.\n\n\n  Are there some general guidelines to understand in which cases the axiom of choice can be  used to construct a provably unique object with certain properties?\n\n\nThis question is motivated by a discussion of uniqueness-properties of certain measure theoretic constructions in mathematical economics that make heavy use of non-standard analysis. \n\nEdit: Examples so far can be classified in three categories: \n\nCardinal Invariants: One uses the axiom of choice to construct a representation by some ordinal. Since ordinals are canonically well ordered, this gives us a unique, definable object with the wanted properties. Example: One takes the dimension (as a cardianl) of a vector space and constructs the vector space as functions on finite subsets of the cardinal (François G. Dorais).\n\nAC Properties: One constructs the object canonically \"by hand\" and then uses the axiom of choice to show that it has a certain property. Trivial example:  $2^\\mathbb{R}$ as the family of well-orderable sets of reals.\n\nEmploying all choice functions: Here one gets uniqueness by requiring the object to contain in some sense all objects of a certain kind that can be obtained by AC. Examples: The Stone-Čech compactification as the set of all ultrafilters on it (Juris Steprans), or the dual space of a vector space, the space of all linear functionals. (Martin Brandenburg) The AC is used to show that these spaces are rich enough.

The longest I've seen was 720 days going back. I suspect they do store everything, but intentionally limit access.\n\nThese transactions are text only, take up extremely little space, and storing an individual's lifetime worth of transaction would take less than 10MB of data; about the storage required by two MP3 files, and about 250k records per person per lifetime, if we generously assume everyone makes 10 transactions a day. But I'd be happy with only the last 10 years of transactions, so about 1MB per customer. One of the largest banks, JP Morgan Chase, has ~70MM credit card customers. That means 70TB of data for 10 years of records - hardly impressive for a corporation of that size, with $17B of net income in 2013, when 1TB of cloud storage costs $10 retail per month.\n\nBy comparison, would you put up with Gmail or any online email provider keeping only the most recent 120 days worth of email? (And emails do take a lot more space than transactions, are far more numerous, and have to be instantly retrievable.)\n\nStorage requirements for transaction activity are trivial in an era where we're throwing around petabytes and zetabytes.\n\nIs there a sound reason for banks not offering access to all your transactions, other than legacy software on their side?\n\n\n\n\n # of connections: 1","I want to build a managed packaged and ultimately deploy it on the AppExchange.

Based on my experiences with John The Ripper, I doubt that repeating a pattern in a password would shorten the time to successfully brute force a password like f00B@rf00B@rf00B@r as opposed to a random string of equal length. However, my doubt is based on the fact that, according to the documentation, JTR does not include a specific attack mode for repeating patterns. JTR, and presumably other brute force tools, can be customized for any arbitrary attack mode. But we can't know how often attackers bother to customize attacks in this way. So then the question becomes mathematical. Please forgive the awkward pseudo mathematical notation. \n\nT = brute force cracking time\n\nPL = pattern of characters of length L\n\nN = number of times PL is repeated\n\nR(LN) = string of random characters of length (L times N)\n\n\nWould it be true that\n\nT(PL*N)= T(R(LN))\n\n\nIf true, then a repeating pattern password would not affect brute force cracking time. But is it true?\n # of connections: 1","I have a site that I am migrating to WordPress, and I have a need to add properties that each of the users can edit (e.g., Address, City, State, Business Name, etc), along with some properties that Administrators can edit (IsActive, CanEmail) that wouldn't be displayed to the user.

Superman says to Lois that he used to play the game as a kid and that he never was very good at it. With whom did he play that would have had those powers? He came to Earth as an infant. Furthermore I don't buy that he was simply talking about hide and seek or some Earthly game. His statement that he was never good at it would not have made sense in that context. \n # of connections: 1","Let's take a wire or a rope. I usually do this with a chain or my scarf.\n\nI fixate one end in my hand and apply rotation (by subtle movements of this endpoint like spinning a lasso). The rope gets into rotation and obtains certain bent shape:\n\n\nSome part is missing because cellphone cameras ain't great for high-speed photos but I hope you can imagine all the scarf.\n\nThe question is: how can I calculate/predict this shape?\n\nAlthough this problem doesn't seem that bizarre, I have never seen any solution. Nor I have found this question asked anywhere on internet... Must be because I just don't know how to formulate it without pictures.\n\nAlso by taking longer rope I get more than one bend:\n\n\nI apoligize for the quality again.

On your next turn, you gain a +4 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls for each attack that you refrained from making against the same opponent. You gain this bonus only against an opponent that you refrained from making an attack of opportunity against in the previous round.\n\n\nI am wondering if this feat is really that good. It seems that it requires a huge investment (in terms of feats) and it is unclear to me whether it really pays off.\n\nThe bonuses +4 AR/dmg per refrained AoO (which you have an infinite supply of (*)) do seem interesting, at first, however:\n\n\nA prerequisite of Stormguard Warrior is Ironheart Aura, which in itself does not seem that interesting, especially for a Crusader (Thicket of Blade is not an Ironheart stance)\nThe bonuses gained can only be used against the opponent that generated them, and no other (it's a minor restriction, but worth keeping in mind)\nAn AoO is likely to do much more damage than 4, especially if using a two-handed weapon (even at level 1, we are looking at 1d10 + 6 ~= 11.5)\n\n\nThus, the two feats investment seems only worth it if one can generate more AoOs than one has available. In the recommendations I have seen, it is combined with Robilar's Gambit (-4 AR, 1 AoO per foe attack in melee) which itself requires Combat Reflexes. Dexterity is unlikely to be ignored (since it benefits Touch AC), and therefore we are looking at a minimum of 3 or 4 available AoOs per round...\n\nLetting Combat Reflexes and Robilar's Gambit aside, is it really worth it investing in Ironheart Aura and Stormguard Warrior? Am I missing something?\n\n(*) I have seen some debates where it is argued that refraining to take an AoO to fuel up Channel the Storm should use it up, which I ignore here. The feat is much worse in this case.\n # of connections: 1","Which of the following is more appropriate / polite?\n\nI would like to bring a couple of facts (or things?) to your notice.\nOR\nI would like to let you know a couple of facts.\n\nPlease advise.\n # of connections: 1","Here are some common definitions from a dictionary for ‘literal’:\n\n\nBeing in accordance with, conforming to, or upholding the exact or primary meaning of a word or words.\nWord for word; verbatim: a literal translation.\nAvoiding exaggeration, metaphor, or embellishment; factual; prosaic: a literal description; a literal mind.\n\n\nSo what does it mean then to ‘take the Bible literally?’ Which definition are we referring to when we say ‘I take the Bible literally?’\n # of connections: 1","My company is in a small town and there are not any graphic designers but we have enough business in the town and the surrounding area to support us.

So here is my problem.  \n\nI created a sign that has an oval with scrolls and flowers in different colors on a field of turquoise.  The client did not want to spend the money on a logo design so I said that I will  just retain the rights so that she would have to come to me for the approval to use the logo on anything else.

Apparently this company did for much less and you can tell by the quality.\n\nBut here is my problem.  She had a jpeg that I allowed her to have so she could create her own fliers and I was ok with that since it would not have made me much if any money.  Well I am looking at the sign that the other person did and all that was done is they made a longer oval since this sign is more rectangle and used a different font.  And put this over the design that I did.  To me this is copyright infringement since the client did not want to buy all the rights.  But who do I address?

When I bought it, it was wrapped in plastic, had been stored in the shop's stock house for about 20 years and free of corrosion.\n\nI'm about 95 kilos, thread quite hard but rides exclusive to paved bike paths. The original, 20(?) year-old wheel lasted me a year with no problems. The front wheel is still fine and true. \n\nSpokes breaking - and getting replaced\n\nAfter a little under a year, I suddenly noticed that a few spokes had broken. On closer inspection, quite a few were too loose. Should have noticed sooner but didn't.\n\nI took it to a shop, where they advised me to have the wheel rebuilt which I paid them to do. The gearing being internal, the new rims and spokes were built on the existing hub.\n\nAfter just two weeks, the back wheel suddenly began to feel wobbly on my way to work. As careful as I could, I drove the bike back to the shop. Almost all spokes were terribly loose.\n\nThey retensioned the wheel free of charge (of course) and sent me on my way. The following weeks, I periodically checked that all spokes were still tensioned.\n\n2,5 months later, I noticed three of the spokes were broken close to the hub. Went back to the shop and had the spokes replaced (free or charge). 1 month later I noticed 2 broken spokes and had those replaced as well. They seemed less eager to keep fixing the wheel free of charge, and when I asked why the spokes kept breaking, the guy muttered something about the hub holes maybe had burrs due to wear.\n\nNow, a few weeks later, I find another spoke broken.\n\nMy gut tells me this all stems from a bad build, that quickly lost tension and thus damaged the spokes. I find the explanation about a worn hub a bit far fetched, but I don't have the knowledge to dismiss the theory.\n\nQuestions\n\nIs there any way this is not the shop's fault? - A bad build? Cheap spokes? Improperly tensioned?\n\nGiven the wheel's history, is there any point in keep replacing spokes, a couple at a time, or should I get the wheel rebuilt (preferably at the shop's expense)?\n\nCould the hub in any way be to blame for this?\n\nThank you!\n\nUpdate Oct 24th\n\nI've been trying to get in touch with the manager of the shop throughout the week. Failed again to reach him this morning, so I figured I'd have a chat about my problem with one of the guys on the floor.\n\nTried to get him to provide at least a theory of why my spokes keep breaking, but not much came out of it really. He mentioned that he've seen, on rare occasaions, that a worn hub could cut the spokes (could be the same guy as I spoke to last time).\n\nI'll check the hubs as soon as possible, as @Daniel R Hicks suggested. Due to plumbing work in our appartment, I haven't been home or able to check my bike all week.\n\nIf I don't see any indicatations that the spokes were put in the wrong way, I'm going to follow the advice most of you have, and take my bike to another shop for advice and repair.\n\nThanks so far! - I'll update you after I've payed the other shop a visit.\n\nUpdate Nov 3rd\n\nTook the bike to the other shop, told them the story. Let them decide to replace the broken spoke or them all.\n\nThey decided to replace just the broken spoke with a DT spoke (what ever that means). They also trued the wheel, which had gotten a slight \"eggy\" shape.\n\nMy fingers are crossed that this wheel will last now.\n\nOnce again, thank you all for your input!\n\nAnecdotal Update\n\nIn case anyone follows... Since the last repair at the other shop, the wheel kept being in good shape. Finally, my spokes stayed tensioned, wheels stiff and true - the long struggle was finally over. Alas, the joy didn't even last a month...\n\nGoing home from a company party, I returned to my bike I parked at the train station, only to find out that some punk kids had apparently tossed it to the ground, and jumped both wheels badly out of shape. Front wheel had to be replaced and back wheel was in desperate need for a trueing. sigh\n\nSorry for the melodrama, just thought I'd update you the faith of my bike ;-).\n # of connections: 1","I have been experiencing a slow draining of the battery for the past 1-2 months wherein the vehicle will be fine and suddenly the vehicle will not start.  \n\nFirst thought was the battery, as the vehicle has about 90000 on it.  I could have tested it, but didn't; just bought another one thinking it would save the trouble soon enough if it wasn't the battery.  On installing the battery, I checked for the usual: lights left on, doors left open, etc.  But there was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nTwo weeks later, the new battery drained. I charged up the old one swapped it in.  One week later, that one was drained.  \n\nDetermined now that it was not the battery, I searched high and low for some good tests.  I did a ground test (all less than 2-1ohm), point to point resistance check(all 1-2ohm), parasitic draw test (30mA after entering sleep mode), and charging voltage test.  Everything looked satisfactory.  The only thing that I noticed was, if I left the nominal voltage charging test run, for minutes, I would slowly watch the voltage creep down.  After twenty minutes I was seeing 13.8V after starting at 14.3V (measured across the battery terminals).  I ran out of time to swap out the battery on my multimeter (thinking this might be the culprit), so it could just be that.  But, I'm curious.  Does a slow fall of the charging voltage (across the battery terminals) indicate an alternator problem?  Belt tensioner problem?

In essence, the analogy stated that God is like fire. Different objects, when dropped into the fire, react differently. Some become hard. Some become soft. Some let off smoke. Some change their hue. Some make a noise. Some might explode. But while all of these different reactions can be found, at no stage is the fire anything other than a fire; the difference in responses to it is to be found in the different objects that come into contact with it.\n\nSo too, the analogy concluded, when it comes to our relationship with God. When we pray, we change ourselves in order that God might interact more favourably with us. We do not hope for God to change in any way, but for ourselves to change instead. God's influence upon the world is constant and unchanging; it is we who are in flux.\n\nDoes this analogy sound familiar to anybody?

Someone mentioned that he guessed the correct number five times in a row, and said that this was surprising because the probability of this happening was $$\\left(\\frac{1}{38}\\right)^5$$\n\nThis is true if you only play the game $5$ times. However, if you play it more than $5$ times there's a higher (should be much higher?) probability that you'll get $5$ in a row at some point. \n\nI was thinking about how surprised this person should be at their streak of $m$ correct guesses given that they play $n$ games, each with probability $p$ of success. It makes intuitive sense that their surprise should be proportional to $1/q$ (or maybe $\\log(1/q)$ since $1$ in a billion doesn't surprise you $10$ times more than $1$ in $100$ million), where $q$ is the probability that they get at least one streak of $m$ correct guesses at some point in their $n$ games. \n\nSo, with the Roulette example I was thinking about, $p=1/38$ and $m=5$. \n\nI tried to find an explicit formula for $q$ in terms of $n$, and encountered some difficulty, because of the non-independence of \"getting a streak in the first five tries\" and \"getting a streak in tries $2$ through $6$\" (if the first is a failure, it's much more  likely that the second will be too). \n\n\n\nIn summary, two questions:\n\n\nHow do I find the probability that you get $5$ correct guesses in a row at some point if you play $n$ games of Roulette?\nMore generally, what is the probability that you get $m$ successes at some point in a series of $n$ events, each with probability $p$ of success? \n\n\nThe variables satisfy $\\,\\,\\,m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $\\,\\,\\,m\\leq n$, $\\,\\,\\,p \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $\\,\\,\\,0 \\leq p \\leq 1$.\n\n\n\nIf we write the answer to the second question as a function $q(m,n,p)$, then we can say that $q$ should be increasing with $n$, decreasing with $m$, and increasing with $p$. It should equal $p^n$ when $m=n$ and should equal $1$ when $p=1$ and $0$ when $p=0$. \n\nI feel as though this should be a basic probability problem, but I'm having trouble solving it. Maybe some kind of recursive approach would work?

I tried to prove it by using induction on the structure of $A$. If $A$ is a formula and $V$ is a model that gives $f$ to all atomic formulas then $V(A) = f$. The base case is $A = p$ and so $V(A) = f$. We assume that it holds for the formulas $B$ and $C$. We have $A = xor(B,C)$ and by using the induction hypothesis and the definition of $xor$ we get $V(A) = f$.\n\nBut I want to show that we cannot create the function $\\land$ I tried using the same method as before but it doesn't seem to work.

Is this true at least for $\\beta$ algebraic integer?\n\nEdit 2: This question came up when trying to solve this problem of mine.\n\n\n\nAll I know so far is that if $\\beta$ is a Pisot integer, i.e. if it is a real algebraic integer greater than $1$ with every conjugate lying in the unit circle, then $\\alpha \\in \\Bbb{Q}(\\beta)$ if and only if it has an ultimately periodic expansion (which is stronger than my question).\n # of connections: 1","One of my concerns before purchasing a car is how expensive repairs are going to be down the road. For example my car up until recently was a Volvo 850, and the air conditioner didn't work in it; the cost of getting it fixed was significantly higher than other cars because of the way the A/C unit is installed in the car, so I went on without air conditioning. Another example is the service light in the car - while the car had a standard OBD-II port which could read error messages, it required a special Volvo reader to reset the service light.\n\nI know a lot of generalizations can be made about one make versus another, but those are obviously not allowed on this site (in fact, I hope this question is allowed at all...) - so that's not what I'm looking for. And I know there is a wide range of problems a car can encounter, and many of them are universal - replacing tires, for (a bad) example.\n\nSo, just like I can go to KBB and look up the recommended price of a car, is there someplace I can go to look up a make &amp; model of a car and see what proprietary, extra-expensive parts are in the car? Something that, for example, I could have put in the Volvo 850 and it would have told me about those above-mentioned peculiarities alongside undoubtedly a number of other proprietary bits that I didn't have problems with.\n # of connections: 1","I am trying to do a very basic thing, which I though I should be able to manage all on my own, but alas.. \n\nWhat I am attempting to do, is to get hold of the values returned by \"df -h\", and to be able to store these values in a bash script array.

Most of my projects contain few (20 or less) images, so I just display them in full size and let the visitor scroll (example) because this is how I prefer to browse other artist's work as well.\n\nFor projects containing more images, I use thumbnails which link to the full-sized images, because, again, when I browse other artist's portfolios, if there are lots of images on a page it's kinda cumbersome to load. \n\nRecently I wrote some jQuery to implement a lightbox effect (modal window overlay) so when you click on a thumbnail, the full-sized image appears (example).\n\nMy main reasons for implementing this:\n\n\nit's much more presentable than having a direct link to the image,\nwhich is what I used to do\nif the visitor shares the image on something like tumblr or\nPinterest, the link back will be to the project page instead of a\ndirect link to the image\nif the visitor wants to right-click on the thumbnails to load several\nimages in several new browser tabs/windows, they can still do so (the\nlightbox is triggered on left click)\n\n\nI did not include a close button because it seems like more work for the visitor to have to look for a close button, than to simply click anywhere to close the lightbox (which is what I did).\n\nWhat are your thoughts regarding lightbox interface for this particular use?\nThe goal would be the best way to showcase visual art/design work, and the target audience would be, well, anyone who wants to view the work.

At this point, I simply want to disable the samsung calendar app from displaying any sort of notifications (since the google app also displays notifications and I want to use that app).\n\nI have been able to do this by going to settings->Notifications in the samsung app and toggling to \"Off\".\n\nHowever, as soon as I restart the device, the notifications are back on their original settings. Anyone else experience this? Anyone know how to make the settings stick?\n\nEDIT: I notice the notification settings of the google developed app (sound, default reminder time, popup) are also not sticking after reboot. Is my device broken? It seems to only be for calendar. Gmail and other apps hold their settings fine.\n\nEDIT 2: Ok, so disabling the samsung app allows my google app calendar settings to stick after reboot. So looks like that is what I will be doing.

He has a hint to use triplets of rationals that bound each simple discontinuity on the left, right, and in between the values of the limits from the left and right. It seems like this can be weakened to just rationals to the left and right. \n\nSimple discontinuities are those in which the limit from the left and right exist, so there must be intervals to the left and right of a simple continuity on which no other simple discontinuity can exist. More precisely, let $c$ and $c'$ be simple discontinuities for $f$ on $(a,b)$ and consider the limit, $l$, of $f$ approaching $c$ from the left:\n\n$\\forall \\epsilon &gt;0, \\exists \\delta&gt;0 : c-x&lt;\\delta \\Rightarrow |l-f(x)|&lt;\\epsilon$\n\nbut $ \\exists \\epsilon '&gt;0 \\forall \\delta ' &gt;0 : |c'-x|&lt;\\delta ' \\Rightarrow |f(c')-f(x)|&gt;\\epsilon '\n\\\\ \\therefore \\epsilon = \\epsilon ' , \\delta ' = \\delta \\rightarrow \\leftarrow\n$\n\nTherefore, you can make an injection from the set of simple discontinuities to a subset of rationals by associating each simple discontinuity with one rational in the aforementioned \"free\" interval to its left; from there compose with the map from rationals to integers to show countable.

The wiki page on RP has more information when needed. Typically, the process from diagnosis of RP to (near) complete loss of eye sight takes years to decades.\n\nHowever, Chebat et al. (2007) make mention that their study group, consisting of congenitally blind subjects, includes one person with RP (see table 1 in the linked article). Hence, this implicates that this particular subject was blind from birth due to effects of RP. \n\nIs anyone familiar with newborns blinded by the effects of RP?\n\n\nReference\nChebat et al.

I had a traditional IRA account with Fidelity and contributed $4000 to it for the Tax Year 2012.\n\nLater in that year (2012), I got a full time job and my employer enrolled me in their 401(k) plan.\n\nWhen the time came to file the taxes, I called Fidelity and explained them the situation as I thought I cannot contribute to Traditional IRA as I have employer sponsored 401(k). Someone at the Fidelity said I can withdraw the money as \"Excess Contribution Withdrawal\". So I filled out the form and pulled $4000 from it. I did not claim the $4000 contribution in my tax return as \"Traditional IRA Contribution\". I just treated it as like I never contributed that money.\n\nNow I got 1099-R from them saying the $4000 that I withdraw was actually processed as \"Early Withdrawal\" and I have to pay tax (33%) on it.\n\nWhen I explained them what happened in 2012, they said they may be able to go back and correct the problem.\n\nWhat I do not understand is that even if they correct the situation and send me revised 1099-R, I will still pay Tax on $4000 as it will be treated as \"Excess Contribution\".\n\nWhy can this not be simple as I made a mistake when I contributed the money and then I took it back and did not claim so that should be treated as like it never went to my IRA account.\n\nWhat can I do to avoid paying \"Excess Withdrawal\" tax as I already paid the tax on this $4000 as I never claimed them on my 2012 return.\n\nAm I missing something here or am I not able to explain them the situation correctly?\n # of connections: 1","I've started playing Eclipse Phase with a group of friends.

Here are my questions;\n\n1- What are these screws/threads actually called, I've seen 1/4 inch and 3/8 inch thrown around a lot and I'd guess that 1/4 inch is the 'normal' one and the 3/8 the 'big' one?\n\n2 - For the GigaPan I'd ideally place it straight onto the 'big' screw, obviously this is not possible, but would this Manfrotto 120 3/8 to 1/4 inch Adaptor be pretty much what I am after.\n\nThese might seem very simple questions but trust me, I consider myself a pretty decent photographer but when it comes to this I really struggle to get my head around it.\n\nThanks!\n\n(also I didn't have the rep to create the tag 'GigaPan', but I think it should be, so feel free to add it! )\n # of connections: 1","I am testing various projections to calculate areas using ICES statistical shapefiles and the QGIS field calculator. \n\nI am using ICES areas downloadable from the following link: http://geo.ices.dk/download.php?dataset=ices_ref:ices_areas.

It seems logical that if it is able to act as both an acid and a base, the equilibrium constants should at least be similar to each other. Instead, one is several order of magnitudes larger than the other? Why can this be true and $\\ce{H2ASO4-}$ still be an amphoteric substance?\n\n\n\nNext, how did they arrive at the statement\n\n\n  We approximately have the equality relation: $$\\ce{[H3AsO4]} = \\ce{[HAsO4^{2−}]}$$\n\n\nWhat is the evidence that shows this to be true? Isn't the $K_a$ value of the basic reaction ($1.6 \\times 10^2$) much larger than that of the acidic reaction? Why should the concentrations be equal?\n\n\n\nFinally, let's say you are calculating the pH for the diprotic substance $\\ce{H2S}$, which undergoes the following diassociations:\n\n$$\\ce{H2S &lt;=&gt; H+ + HS-}$$\n$$\\ce{HS- &lt;=&gt; H+ + S^{2-}}$$\n\nTo find the pH you would assume that the first reaction is dominant, and that the effects of the second reaction consuming $\\ce{HS-}$ are minimal, and then calculate the pH from there — right? \n\nHowever, why can't you treat $\\ce{HS-}$ as an amphoteric substance (because it can both gain and lose a proton) and then calculate the pH as you would for an amphoteric substance (as seen in the image at the beginning)?\n # of connections: 1","I am reading Ludwig's paper \"Electromagnetic and gravitational responses and anomalies in topological insulators and superconductors\", and in this paper, although I am clear how they get the descent equation which introduced the relationship between anomaly and the existence of topological insultor, I am confused about the theta-term they mentioned on section VA5, they said that the integral of anomaly polynomial $\\Omega_{2n+2}$ corresponds to the $\\theta$ term.

One can attempt to communicate through the common tongue, language particular to a creature class, or one of the divisional languages (lawful good, etc.). While not understanding the language, creatures who speak a divisional tongue will recognize a hostile one and attack.\n\n\nMoldvay D&amp;D says:\n\n\n  Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Basic Rules, page B11\n  \n  Alignment Languages\n  \n  Each alignment has a secret language of passwords, hand signals, and other body motions.  Player characters and intelligent monsters will always know their alignment languages.  They will also recognize when another alignment language is being spoken, but will not understand it.  Alignment languages are not written down, nor may they be learned unless a character changes alignment.  When this happens, the character forgets the old alignment language and starts using the new one immediately.\n\n\nWhat?\n\nSo much of Dungeons and Dragons was very generic \"sword and sorcery\" fantasy that these rules always stuck out to me as an extremely sore thumb, or like one of those snails that has been infected by a fungus and begins to pulsate in random colors.  What the heck is going on here?\n\nSo, alignment languages show up pretty early in D&amp;D's history.  Every intelligent being that is on the side of Law can communicate.  Every intelligent being that has no particular feelings about Law can, too.  If they experience a profound change in their feelings about this, they can no longer communicate with the people they used to.  It isn't clear how much communication is possible in an alignment language, since Moldvay describes it as \"passwords, hand signals, and other body motions.\"\n\nIn AD&amp;D 1E, though, there is no such limitation:\n\n\n  Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, page 34\n  \n  Character Languages\n  \n  In addition to the common tongue, all intelligent creatures able to converse in speech use special languages particular to their alignment. These alignment languages are: Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Chaotic Neutral, lawful Evil, Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, Neutral Evil, Neutral Good, and Neutrality. The alignment of your character will dictate which language he or she speaks, for only one alignment dialect can be used by a character (cf. CHARACTER CLASSES, The Assassin). If a character changes alignment, the previously known longuage is no longer able to be spoken by him or her.\n\n\nThat cross-reference to the assassin class is there because assassins alone can learn the languages of other alignments.  Probably not all of them, though, because now there are nine instead of three.\n\nIn AD&amp;D 2E, the alignment language seems to have been silently dropped, and never spoken of again as far as I know.\n\nWhen I was ten and played AD&amp;D, the idea of alignment languages struck me as incomprehensible, and today even though I have come to love almost everything about basic and early-Advanced D&amp;D, alignment languages still seem incomprehensible, weird, and unexplained.\n\nWhat I want to know is this: how were (or are) alignment languages put to use, described, and conceived of in actual play ?  So far, my use of them has always been \"pretend they do not exist.\"  I am curious as to how others view and address them.\n\nAlso:  where did this bizarre idea come from?

I will show the $a^ib^j$ are distinct for $i=0,1$ and $j=0,1,2$. If $i=0$, $b^0=e,b,b^2$ are distinct. We know order of $b$ is not $2$ as $b^3=e$ as the order of an element divides powers that make $b$ the identity, this would mean $2\\mid 3$ a contradiction. For $i=1$,\n$$ab^i=ab^k \\rightarrow b^i=b^k \\rightarrow i\\equiv k \\mod{3}$$\nbut as $0\\leq i,k &lt; 3$, $i=k$ so $a,ab,ab^2$ are distinct.\n\nSo we have that $G \\supseteq \\{e,a,b,b^2,ab,ab^2\\}.$ So\n$$G=\\left&lt;a,b\\right&gt; =\\{ a^{n_1}b^{n_2}\\cdots a^{n_r}b^{n_{r+1}}\\mid n_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$$\nand as $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e$, $ab=ba$ and so we can write $G$ as\n$$G=\\{a^nb^m \\mid n,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}.$$\nWe then also have by $a^{-1}b^{-1}ab=e$ that\n$$a^{-1}b=ba^{-1},\\,a^{-1}b^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1},\\,ab^{-1}=b^{-1}a$$\nand so any\n$$a^nb^m=a\\cdots a\\cdot b\\cdots b =b^ma^n$$\nas we can commute the elements to get $b^ma^n$ so $G$ is abelian. To show there are exactly $6$ elements, if we pick any $a^nb^m \\in G$, we can assume that $0\\leq n\\leq 1$ and $0\\leq m \\leq 2$ and then this element is already accounted for above so\n$$G=\\{e,a,b,b^2,ab,ab^2\\}.$$\nAs $G$ is a finite abelian group of order $6$, $G$ can be written uniquely up to permutation as a direct sum of $\\mathbb{Z}_{p_i^{k_i}}$'s where the $p_i$ are prime but there is only one way to do this for $6=2\\cdot3$ so this means\n$$G\\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}_3\\cong\\mathbb{Z}_6$$\nas $\\gcd(2,3)=1$.\n\nI am just wondering of nicer ways to argue this in the case I would need to do this on an exam.

It's split up into the following layers:\n\n\nPresentation - HTML\nService layer - A REST and SOAP API communicating with the business layer\nBusiness layer - Contains the business logic.\nData access - Provides access to the storage (SQL etc)\n\n\nThe business layers contains classes encapsulating specific areas, such as customer registration, user management and more. The problem we are seeing is that the business layer is starting to get a bit messy. We have a single class handling customer management but as this area of the application grows more and more complex, the class grows and grows and become messy.\n\nFor example, we may have the following classes\n\n\nclass CustomerManager\n\n\nvoid CreateCustomer(...)\nvoid DeleteCustomer(...)\n\nclass UserManager\n\n\nvoid CreateUser(..)\nvoid DeleteUser(...) \nvoid ActivateUser(...)\nvoid InactivateUser(...)\nvoid ResetPassword(...) \n\n\n\nCreating a customer involves creating users as well. So CustomerManager calls misc methods in the UserManager class. As the application has evolved, creating a new customer means roughly 10 different things needs to be done except for registring the customer in the database, such as informing sales, audit logging, configuring default user accounts, creating a default configuration for the customer, notifying end-users of their auto-generated passwords and more. So CustomerManager.CreateCustomer grows to ~100 lines of fairly hairy code.\n\nI'm trying to think of a good way to handle this but am assuming that there's some common good way to do this which I'm simply not aware of.\n\nI've considered creating \"Task\"/\"Command\" classes implementing small sub-processes and then let the CustomerCreation.CreateCustomer simply execute a set of tasks. I would have more classes but they would each do less things.\n\nI've also considering implementing some kind of global application-level event/plug-in systems where CustomerManager.CreateCustomer just creates the customer in the database and then publishes an event that the customer is created. Plug-ins/something can then subscribe to these events and do stuff such as informing sales and logging the fact.

Building a regular expression to search for a pattern inside a particular string generally isn't a problem for me, but I have a (maybe?) unique situation.\n\nI have a set of values, say:\n\n\n  028938\n  DEF567987\n  390987.456\n  GHI345928.039  \n\n\nI want to match a certain set of strings, such as:\n\n\nStrings composed of exactly 6 digits\nStrings composed of exactly 6 digits, a decimal, followed by exactly 3 more digits\n\n\nIn the above examples, the first and third values should be matched.\n\nI'm using the regular expressions:\n\n[0-9]{6}\n[0-9]{6}.[0-9]{3}\n\n\nUnfortunately, since all the above examples contain the specified pattern, all values are matched. This is not my intention.\n\nSo my question, in a nutshell, is how to write a regular expression that matches a string exactly and completely, with no additional characters to the right or left of the matched pattern? Is there a term for this type of matching? (Google was no help.) TIA\n # of connections: 1","How do the limited timed games on Steam works?

I used it for about 4 or 5 years all throughout high school and then (as an avid film photographer) begrudgingly made the switch over to digital in college. But the Minolta definitely gave me experience in photography and people genuinely enjoyed my photographs.\n\nEarly on, I don't know if I was just enamoured with the idea of vibrant digital images from an SLR or if I just didn't notice enough, but I don't remember a whole lot of images that came out blurry in the beginning. Maybe 60% of them (a liberal estimate). I accidentally deleted about a year's worth of early pictures so I'm unable to tell now.\n\nThe preview in the viewfinder doesn't appear to be blurry at all; then again, there's a huge different between the 3\" preview screen and my 20\" computer monitor.\n\nHere are things I've tried:\n\n\nUsing a tripod (although, as you can tell, the issue is not a motion blur issue).\nTried different aperture settings (for example, the landscape image is f/22).\nTried different ISO.\nManual focus.\nAuto focus.\nManually \"de-focusing\" the object (focusing behind it and focusing in front of it). Although, with the picture of the butterfly, this doesn't seem to be the case: it has varying depth of field and even the supposedly \"in-focus\" butterfly is out of focus.\nChanging the \"sharpening\" property via the camera: Menu > Set Picture Control > (picture control -- e.g. \"Neutral\") > Sharpening\nWent into a physical repair shop and they did test images. They didn't seem to find a problem, patted me on the head, and told me to be a good photographer and use the autofocus.\nLetting someone else take the picture.\nChromatic aberration correction (typically through Digikam)\nDifferent Lenses. The two below are using my AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm 1.3.5-5.6 G lens. I have a AF-S Nikkor 55-200mm 1.4-5.6G ED telephoto and get the same result (sometimes result is worse -- can post an example if needed).\nAnd, oh, yeah, I even sent it into Nikon...three times. They said they fixed the problem. But, you know how those things go...\n\n\nOddly enough I've looked up reviews for my camera and both lenses and couldn't find many (if any) reviews stating blurry pictures for every picture.\n\nA few thoughts:\n\n\nCould whichever photo editing program I'm using be the cause of the blur? I used Linux so I've used Digikam (my favorite), F-Spot, and the Gimp.\nMaybe it's normal for digital pictures to be blurry compared to film? Digital doesn't use crystals like film, so the opposite should seem true. I wonder this because a lot of work has gone into sharpening tools like unsharpen mask.\n\n\nSorry for the long post and various photo examples.

So this question is to ask about the ethics directly.\n\nSuppose I have written and published a textbook, and I want to use it as the text for a course I am teaching.  I receive royalties from each copy of my book that is sold, so if my students are required to buy my textbook for the course, I will make some money.  Is it ethical to do so?\n\nWell-reasoned opinions would be useful answers, but even more useful would be pointers to institutional policies, professional codes of ethics, etc, that address this issue.\n\nOf course, there are many ways to avoid profiting from the sale of my book to my students.  If my contract with my publisher allows it, I could distribute PDFs to my students, or have the university bookstore print out copies and sell them at cost.  Another approach I've heard of is to compute how much I earn in royalties on each copy, and refund that amount from my pocket to each student who buys a copy.  Or, use my royalty earnings to buy pizza for the class.  Certainly these are nice gestures, but I would like opinions on whether they are ethically required.\n\nEdit: To address some questions that have arisen in the comments:\n\n\nThis question is hypothetical.  I haven't published any textbooks myself and have no immediate plans to do so.  In any case, my personal preference would be to make the book available to students for free, if at all possible.  So I've phrased this question in the first person for rhetorical convenience only.\nI had intended the question to be only about the potential financial conflict of interest that could arise if I make money by assigning my own book.  Some of the answers feel that it is improper for me to assign my own textbook at all, whether I make money or not, but I don't think this point of view is prevalent within the academic community.  If it happens that my book (as a pithy but now-deleted comment put it) \"blows\", I think most would agree that my decision to assign it is pedagogically unfortunate, but not unethical.  \nI don't literally mean that students would be required to buy the book, only that they'd be expected to have it.  I might assign readings or homework problems from the book, so that the student needs access to the book in order to do them, but they could certainly achieve this by getting a used copy or borrowing from a friend.  But probably most students would buy new copies anyway, since that is the most convenient way.\n\n # of connections: 1","I'm looking for a library which do this :\n\n\nRetrieve a JSON through an AJAX call\nPopulate table with the JSON\nUpdate in real time the table with the JSON (call every x seconds) and only delete or hide the rows wich are deleted or insert the new rows.\n\n\n/Editing after first answer\n\nOk i guess my first explanation was not good.\nRetrieving through jquery a json and build a table is good, i could do that, but my request was more on the other part. \nI'm looking for a library to display the result in a special way. \nLet me explain. \nJson request 1 send : \n1;Tomato 2;Apple 3;Salad 4;Carot \n\nJson request 2 send : \n1;Tomato 3;Salad 4;Carot 5;Potatoes \n\nI would like the second row disapear with a effect (fadeOut) and the rows below move Up.

I'm having a strange issue where the dates aren't showing up correctly in my infowindows on the Google Map, but they show up fine using the same code outside of the infowindow.\n\nSo, I have a 'Location' channel, and an 'Event' channel. The Event channel is associated with the Calendar module, and uses a Playa single relationship field to relate it to a Location.\n\nI am adding markers to the map for every 'Location', and for each marker, I'm populating the infowindow with the Location details. this includes using the Playa:Parents method to show all of the events that are at that location. \n\nI copied the code from the Solspace Calendar demo template for a single event to show the event date, because it had all the conditionals all worked out to deal with single day or multi-day events well. \n\nMy problem is that in the infowindow, it's only showing the 'From' date, and not the 'To' part of the date string. It shows it correctly when I output it outside of the map, though. Here is the code that is outputting the date information. \n\n    {exp:calendar:events}\n    &lt;b&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; {event_first_date format=\"%F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a\"}\n    {if event_never_ends}\n        (never ends)\n    {if:else}\n        {if \"{event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}\" != \"{event_last_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}\"} &lt;b&gt;to:&lt;/b&gt;\n            {if \"{event_first_date format=\"%Y%m%d\"}\" != \"{event_last_date format=\"%Y%m%d\"}\"}\n                {event_last_date format=\"%l, %F %j, %Y at %g:%i%a\"}\n            {if:else}\n                {event_last_date format=\"%g:%i%a\"}\n            {/if}\n        {/if}\n    {/if}\n    &lt;a href=\"{path=find-music/event/{url_title}}\"&gt;{title}&lt;/a&gt;\n{/exp:calendar:events}\n\n\nBut this is how it outputs, in the infowindow, and outside of the map.\n\n(crap, I don't have enough 'reputation' to post the image here, but it's here: http://paleosun.com/misc/stackexchange-map-calendar-question.jpg)\n\nNotice, the section below the map has the \"to\" date.

The {if \"{event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}\" != \"{event_last_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'}\"} part is never resolving to 'true' like it should. In fact, If I just try to output {event_first_date format='%Y%m%d%g%i%a'} in the infowindow part, nothing show up. However, if I use double quotes and output {event_first_date format=\"%Y%m%d%g%i%a\"} it DOES work.

Suddenly, our secure writes have started failing if power is lost immediately after the flush.\n\nAlthough including commode.obj causes fflush to commit, even on Win7, I've always preferred to use the MS-specific commit mode flag (\"c\") on Windows (the Linux version uses a completely different method), because as I write the library not the products, I can never be sure that commode.obj has actually been included, so I can't throw an error.\n\nFILE* p_f = fopen(\"foo.dat\", \"wbc\");\nfwrite(p_important_stuff, 1, size, p_f);\nfflush(p_f);\n\n\nSo my question is: Is the commit mode flag broken on Win7, and if so is there a way I can guarantee commode.obj is included, or is there some other way I can change the state of the global commit flag?\n # of connections: 1","At one of my employers, we worked on a REST (but it also applies to SOAP) API. The client, which is the application UI, would make calls over the web (LAN in typical production deployments) to the API. The API would make calls to the database.\n\nOne theme that recurs in our discussions is performance: some people on the team believe that you should not have multiple database calls (usually reads) from a single API call because of performance; you should optimize them so that each API call has only (exactly) one database call.\n\nBut is that really important? Consider that the UI has to make a network call to the API; that's pretty big (order of magnitude of milliseconds). Databases are optimized to keep things in memory and execute reads very, very quickly (eg. SQL Server loads and keeps everything in RAM and consumes almost all your free RAM if it can).\n\nTLDR: Is it really significant to worry about multiple database calls when we are already making a network call over the LAN? If so, why?\n\nTo be clear, I'm talking about order of magnitude -- I know that it depends on specifics (machine hardware, choice of API and DB, etc.) If I have a call that takes O(milliseconds), does optimizing for DB calls that take an order of magnitude less, actually matter? Or is there more to the problem than this?\n\nEdit: for posterity, I think it's quite ridiculous to make claims that we need to improve performance by combining database calls under these circumstances -- especially with a lack of profiling. However, it's not my decision whether we do this or not; I want to know what the rationale is behind thinking this is a correct way of optimizing web API calls.\n # of connections: 1","Let $f: \\mathbb C \\to \\mathbb C$ be an entire function.

The ground distance from the secondary sites is a little more than 2km for the one closer and around 2.9km for the one furthest. \n\nThe link will be used to transmit the video feed of 1 (or even possibly two) IP cameras and some kind of Ethernet-enabled environmental or weather sensor. I have checked the necessary b/w for the cameras and both 900Mhz and 5.8Ghz are more than adequate for even 4 of them, much more for 2. I have also verified that there is clear line-of-sight to both possible installation points and that the 60% Fresnel Zone clearance is more than covered. Bear in mind that this is my first long distance link (long with or without quotes) and I hate to admit that wireless physics is far from my strong suit.\n\nThe ultimate point of my question is that although I have read a lot about frequency choice the last few days, I continue to find some ambiguity (I know it is just me that finds it ambiguous). Most sources, like this one, agree that although the lower frequencies have less losses over a given distance (free-space-loss I learned it is called) they need larger antennae for the same \"strength\" of trasmission (is \"gain\" really the same as \"strength\"?). \n\nSo, for the given distance of 2-3km and given also that all typical requirements are met, which is preferable (or do I dare say \"better\") frequency? Should I choose 900Mhz with a relatively \"small\" antenna on the basis that 3km is not really \"long distance\" and that it will provide a link with less attenuation ergo less retransmits ergo higher overall speed? Or should I choose the 5.8Ghz option for the superior b/w (I am still not very sure about this, please correct me if wrong) on the basis that at this distance there is no real difference so why not take the \"better\" one?\n\nOn a side note, should I stay to the beaten path of true WiFi or should I consider proprietary bridging solutions like the ones from Ubiquiti? I have a lot of experience with their Access Points and am really satisfied, so I would not mind integrating one more of their products in my client. In any case, I am looking for an optimal solution, choice of vendor is of very little concern at this point.\n\nForgive my ignorance and the possible mistaken use of language. \n\nUPDATE:\nI arranged to have a spectrum analyzer on loan for a couple of days. I will make sure that the 900Mhz band is reasonably clear and proceed down that way.\n\nUPDATE 2:\nI had the aforementioned equipment available to play with for a day and a half. The conclusive finding is that the 9Mhz band is almost \"empty\" in the area, as one suggested here, so that takes care for the frequency choice issue. \n\nConcerning the equipment now, I am going with Ubiquiti AirMax Yagi antennae and matching RM900 2x2 radios.

I thought the C89 standard did not allow this. (GCC Version: 4.4.3) It even happens when I explicitly use --std=c89 on the compile line. I know that most compilers implement things that are non-standard, i.e. C compilers allowing // comments, when the standard does not specify that. I'd like to learn just the standard, so that if I ever need to use just the standard, I don't snag on things like this.\n\nQuestion #2: How do you cope without objects in C? I program as a hobby, and I have not yet used a language that does not have Objects (a.k.a. OO concepts?) -- I already know some C++, and I'd like to learn how to use C on it's own. Supposedly, one way is to make a POD struct and make functions similar to StructName_constructor(), StructName_doSomething(), etc. and pass the struct instance to each function - is this the 'proper' way, or am I totally off?\n\nEDIT: Due to some minor confusion, I am defining what my second question is more clearly: I am not asking How do I use Objects in C?

Since an ideal $I \\subseteq R$ is maximal if and only if $R/I$ is a field, it suffices to prove that $\\mathbb{Q}[x,y]/(x,y)$ is a field.\nLet $\\phi : \\mathbb{Q}[x,y] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Q}$ be the evaluation homomorphism that sends $p(x,y)$ to $p(0,0)$. $\\phi$ is clearly surjective and if I prove that the kernel of $\\phi$ is the ideal $(x,y)$, the result will follow by the First Isomorphism Theorem.    \n\n$(x,y) \\subseteq Ker(\\phi)$ is obvious, but to prove the reverse inclusion, my idea is to take a polynomial $p(x,y) \\in Ker(\\phi)$ and to perform Euclidean division of $p(x,y)$ with $y$ and $x$ in $(\\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$ and $(\\mathbb{Q}[y])[x]$ respectively. The problem is that neither of them is a polynomial ring over field. There is a theorem saying that if R is commutative and if $R[x]$ is a PID, then $R$ is a field. Since neither $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$, nor $\\mathbb{Q}[y]$ are fields, it follows that neither $(\\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$, nor $(\\mathbb{Q}[y])[x]$ are PIDs, hence are not Euclidean domains.   \n\nObviously, Euclidean division does not solve the problem. If we consider $p(x,y)$ as an element in $(\\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$ and if we divide by $y$, then we get a quotient $q(x,y)$ and a remainder which is $0$ or of degree $0$ over $(\\mathbb{Q}[x])[y]$, hence a polynomial $r(x)$ in $x$ only.    \n\nThen, $p(x,y) = yq(x,y) + r(x)$ and the hypothesis $p(0,0)=0$ does not guarantee that $r(x)=0$. So, we cannot conclude that $y$ divides $p(x,y)$.\n\nIs there a way to remedy this proof, or is there another approach to this problem?\n # of connections: 1","In Seven Psychopaths Charlie (Woody Harrelson) comes to the hospital to find Mrs Kieslowski.

(I ask this as someone who mostly enjoys games like Carcassonne, Power Grid, Agricola, Pandemic, etc. around the table at home.)  To be specific, the things that I think are important properties for these games are:\n\n\nNeeding minimal table space.  Most trains have a small table you could use, but not much more.\nBeing quiet to play, so that other passengers won't be disturbed.  For example, I imagine that games that involve repeatedly rolling dice wouldn't be appreciated.\nPacking down small, so that they don't take up much luggage space.\nNot requiring batteries or a power socket.  (I appreciate that an iPhone or a Nintendo DS for each player might be a good solution more generally, but it's not what I'm after in this case.)\nNot being so delicate to arrange that motion from the train will unduly disrupt the play.\n\n\nI think it would be best to recommend one game (or class of games) per answer, if that's appropriate, and explain why you think it's particularly suitable.  (Incidentally, I've read the guidance on good questions about game recommendations and hope this question meets the criteria.)\n\nUpdate: Thanks for so many excellent suggestions - we certainly won't be short of games for our next long train journey :)\n\nUpdate 2: Unfortunately, I can't really playtest this many great games in any reasonable time period, so I'm going to accept the top-voted answer (Cribbage) and try out the others as soon as I can.

But seemingly this is not enough to find inverse of $1-ab$ in $R$.\n\nIn other direction I can only show that: $1-ab$  is invertible $\\Rightarrow ab\\neq1\\Rightarrow a$ is not a unit and hence is an element of a maximal ideal.

One is that Chinese restaurant food is totally made up, and has no similarity with food anywhere in the world. In which case, I'd better give up trying to find the right location. This seems to be the case with fried ice cream, which Wikipedia suggests is an artificial modern invention.\n\nThe other is that maybe I visited the wrong location. China is a big place, after all. Perhaps visiting another area, such as Inner Mongolia, would find me what I'm looking for, with dishes either the same as, or the un-modified version of what is served in western countries' Chinese restaurants.\n\nThe Wikipedia article on Chinese restaurant mentions:\n\n\n  There has additionally been a consequential component of Chinese\n  emigration of illegal origin, most notably Fuzhou people from Fujian\n  Province and Wenzhounese from Zhejiang Province in Mainland China,\n  specifically destined to work in Chinese restaurants in New York City,\n  beginning in the 1980s.\n\n\nAs Fujian province is right next to Taiwan, and has had a major influence on it, it seems plausible that if some of the \"Chinese restaurant\" dishes were coming from Fujian, I would have seen them in Taiwan, but I didn't.\n\nWhere, if anywhere, can I find the dishes that feature in western countries' Chinese restaurants?

So far the discussion of hacking back in this manner has been discussed by lawyers, some shouting it is legal, and others saying it isn't. What they do agree on is that there's no case law, and until there is there will be no clear answer. Also, legalities vary from nation to nation, so the answer to legality is \"maybe\" and \"it depends where you are\". \n\nHowever so far none of the discussion I've seen has been among IT Security professionals who would be the ones to design, deploy, and run systems that would to the hacking back. The lawyers all seem to think that organizations would adopt the technique as a matter of course, but I am not in agreement with that and I would like to hear the views of my peers. This is why I've asked the question apart from legal and ethical aspects. \n # of connections: 1","I'm trying to design a circuit which can measure small resistances down to 0.1 Ohm and a max. of 10 Ohms. I won't be measuring actual resistors but rather large coil of wires, upto 500 m (as you can imagine, these wires are quite thick).\n\nHere's the circuit I came up with:\n\n\nThe circuit works by maintaining a constant current through the device under test, R2. With a current of 100 mA, R2 would develop a voltage between 10 mV to 50 mV.\n\nI think in an ideal world this would work but in practice I may have a hard time measuring 0.1 Ohms with this - mainly due to the ADC. Let's assume the ADC is 10-bit with VREF of 5V. This translates to 5mV per step. If R2 = 0.1 and Iout = 100 mA, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 50 mV - but I'm not sure how buried under noise this would be.\n\nMy question is, should I increase the gain to, say, 50. If the gain is 50, then the voltage present at the ADC would be 500 mV - but the max. measurable resistance would be 1 Ohms. To measure 10 Ohms, I would need to lower the current to 10 mA instead of 100 mA. A way to do that would be use an FET to switch out R1 and connect a 20 Ohm resistor at Iout.\n\nI don't need the circuit to measure the resistance precisely - a tolerance of +/- 10% is fine.\n # of connections: 1","I am considering building my next PC into a server rack case, the reason is I am getting a server cabinet and will be putting in a few servers in it.

One thing that I am not able to figure out, though, is multitasking.\n\nIn theory, the operating system manages time, according the CPU for small intervals to the various programs running. But it is not clear how this really works.\n\nSay the operating system wants to start my program. The machine code is loaded somewhere in RAM, starting at a certain address. I guess then a jump should be performed to that address, allowing my code to execute. But in this way, the OS cannot regain control until I jump back.\n\nBasically, I can imagine just two ways of making this work, but neither seems really suitable:\n\n\nThe operating system could read the machine instructions I want to perform and emulate them instead of executing them directly. I am intentionally vague, since I do not know how this would work, but it seems like it would slow down the program considerably.\nAlternatively, the operating system could wait until I make a system call. In that moment it regains control and can check how long I have been running and do its timesharing stuff. This may work, but it seems unreliable, as I could make a long calculation which does not involve system calls and hang everything for a while.\n\n\nSo, it seems neither mechanism would work very well.

And indeed this is again strengthened when we see that the actions as performed by his father when supposedly \"repairing the mess\" that Finn created are directly represented by Lord Business' micromanagers performing them inside the in-universe viewpoint of the other LEGO figures.\n\nUpto this point that is a reasonable and obvious representation to me and even Emmet's direct witness of the universe behind his, our real world, is nothing but him seeing the strips behind the course of his own universe, however he managed to overcome this boundary between dimensions.

Does it have any deeper implications for the depicted realities? Does this establish the LEGO figures as existent and sentient within our physical reality outside of our mere fantasy?

I have studied much about encapsulation but the more I read the more I became confused.\n\nI understand we hide (by making private) data and expose it to user of class (other developers) as properties or methods. I also understand by encapsulation we hide details.\n\nIn an article (http://www.csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/lesson19) I read:\n\nAbstract from article\n\nWhen designing an object, you must think about how others could use it. In a best-case scenario any program using the object would be well designed and the code would never change. However, the reality is that programs do change often and in a team environment many people touch the same code at one time or another. Therefore, it is beneficial to consider what could go wrong as well as the pristine image of how the object should be used.\n\nIn the case of the BankAccount object, examine the situation where code outside of your object could access a decimal Amount field or a string CustomerName field. At the point of time that the code is written, everything would work well. However, later in the development cycle, you realize that the BankAccount object should keep track of an int CustomerID rather than string CustomerName because you don't want to duplicate relationships between information (or some other valid reason to alter the definition of internal state). Such changes cause a rippling effect in your code because it was built to use the BankAccount class, as originally designed (with CustomerName being a string), and you must now change code that accesses that state throughout your entire application.\n\nThe object-oriented principle of Encapsulation helps avoid such problems, allowing you to hide internal state and abstract access to it though type members such as methods, properties, and indexers. Encapsulation helps you reduce coupling between objects and increases the maintainability of your code. \n\nQuestion\nHow will encapsulation help when making changes in code and from its rippling effects.\nFor a data member, if I change its type from int to float, (even if I am exposing this using property) I will need to change variable type where I am using already using this code.\n\nKindly guide me how encapsulation will help with such changes.\n\nThanks for this help and guidance.\n # of connections: 1","I'm in the process of creating a web app. I have many randomly-generated non-player characters in a database.

It's made quite clear that they can interface with each other through mental transceivers and they make a big deal about thoughts being a more efficient communication method than verbal communication in Scorpion Part 2 with Tuvok and Janeway.  Therefore, wouldn't a mental interface with a computer be more efficient?

I observed that there's always some latency, the players always get updates from past actions. But there are techniques like dead reckoning to handle the latency. I can predict the movement and make movements smooth. But how would I make actions synchronize like jumping, stopped walking, etc.\n\nSuppose, client A was moving, he was at 100m at 10.2 time with 100m/sec velocity and sended this information. Client B would receive this information somewhat later, let it be 10.4. So at client B, I can use prediction and place client A at 120m. But what if, client made a jump at 110m at 10.3. I can't predict that and since I have been using prediction I can't show client A jump in past.\n\nI may deal with this problem by not sending jump action at all. But what if my game has some voids where players can fall and die. So, If I don't sync jump actions, other players will observe that one player was running then he falls in void and then again appear on the screen destroying the visual engagement. \n\nJump is just an example, there might many scenarios where prediction can't work. So, How do deal with them. One such example can be Multiplayer Online battle arena games like Awesomenauts.\n # of connections: 1","I want to delete few particles from particle system.

My understanding is that 1024-bit DH (ephemeral or not) is of comparable security to 1024-bit RSA. Why would he make such a recommendation?

For a plane wave and imagining it as a fluid bouncing off the reflection wall at $x=0$, find the force in terms of $\\phi'(0)$, the derivative of wave function at $x=0$. \n\nWe know, for a reflecting fluid, $\\textrm{force }= \\frac{dp}{dt}$, where $p$ is momentum. Classically, $p=mv$. In our case, $v$ is $\\hbar k/m$, the velocity of the plane wave. Instead of mass, we have $|\\phi|^2dx$, the probability of finding the massive particle in an interval $dx$. So $p= \\frac{\\hbar k}{m}|\\phi|^2 dx$. Then, force $f=\\frac{dp}{dt} =\\frac{d(|\\phi|^2 dx \\hbar k/m)}{dt}$\n\nBy the continuity equation, \n$\\frac{d(|\\phi|^2)}{dt}=-\\frac{dj}{dx}$, where $j$ is probability current = $\\hbar k/m |\\phi|^2$.\nSo $f=\\frac{dp}{dt}=\\left(\\frac{\\hbar k}{m}\\right)^2 \\frac{d(|\\phi|^2)}{dx} = \\frac{\\hbar k}{m} 2 \\phi \\phi' dx$. \n\nBut for infinite potential, $\\phi(0)=0$, so this gives 0. So I have an unwanted $\\phi$ and a pesky $dx$ in my problem. I'm stumped for days, I'd appreciate all help. I'm fairly sure I should be getting an answer of force ~ $\\phi'(0)^2$.\n # of connections: 1","If $f_n$ is a sequence of functions over $[0, \\pi/2]$ given by\n\n$$f_n(x) = \\frac {nx} {1+n\\sin(x)},$$\n\nthen how would I go about proving that $f_n$ does not converge uniformly to a function $f$ on $[0, \\pi/2]$?\n # of connections: 1","I'm using the biglm package to run a regression on a data set.

Originally, I started out seeking computer help from a couple of subcommunities where I could learn and get help with my computer problems. Itself  is a great idea and there are a few forums that offer similar help resources.\n\nWhat makes Stack Exchange different is that it expands across so many arenas with a single account making it a very expansive place to give and take. For example, I found myself on the English Learning site where I actually have a lot to contribute. I am actually an English teacher but I have computer problems sometimes.\n\nOne thing though, the reputation points don't carry over across subcommunities which I think is a bit detrimental and defeating the purpose in a way.\n\nMy arguments are:\n\n\nIf the purpose of reputation points is to build a character reference, then shouldn't it be global? For instance, I can be helpful in one community and have a ton of reputation but a complete 'weirdo' in another. Whereas a universal point system wouldn't allow this. Reputation as a whole builds your identity across multiple communities.\nI join a new community and I am limited to what I can post (even if my post can be useful or helpful). Specifically, I ran across this during commenting. I had a perfectly viable comment to help a person but wasn't allowed because I didn't have reputation but I had reputation in another community. I had to post it as an answer and then I got 'moderated' by the community on where I should post and was down voted for leaving a comment in the answer area. Thus, losing reputation.\nIt doesn't seem to create a way for incentives in some cases. For example, I have computer problems and I can't say I am phenominal at solving or answering computer questions. I could ask a question that may not get answered but if I have enough reputation I could put a bounty on it as incentive to get people to answer it. BUT WAIT!! I can't really earn reputation on a computer community to put a bounty on a question because there is nothing I can really answer or be helpful with.\n\n\nHowever, I am great at writing, editing and dealing with international students!!! But, what is the sense of me just racking up points in a community when I will hardly need to ask a question much less put a bounty on it? Sure, points are great. It's nice to have a lot of points but what if I need them elsewhere?\n\nSo, when I need computer help desperately I can use my reputation collected from another community to put incentive in trying to get a question answered. Essentially, I'm a good guy and helpful at something but I am not a computer whiz. \n\nEveryone is good at something and thats what the community at large should be in my opinion.\n\nJust my opinion. I used my situation personally to explain but I am sure other people have experienced a similar situation or have had a similar thought.\n # of connections: 1","I'm trying to make a cheat-sheet for my Math class.

I took a tutorial for client-server socket programming for VB.NET.  I then tried to implement it using a service rather than a program.  I understand how it works as a program, but when I try to port it over to a service it doesn't work.  When I run the service it starts and stops instantly.  It never makes a connection.  Unfortunately, I am not that great of VB.net programmer but so far I am liking it a lot for rapid development of programs.\n\nThe idea of this service is to:\n\n\nrun when the computer starts\ngrab the name of the PC\nSend the name of the PC to the server\n\na.   the server then takes the name and looks it up in a database\n\nb.   returns the time that the client machine is suppose to back up\nThe client machine then does the math for the current time and the time it’s suppose to backup &amp; put everything in ms.\nThen the machine backs up at that specified time by running a dos command to launch the program.\n\n\nNow to answer a question that I have found common in the forums.  Why don't I use task scheduler.  Well I did use task schedule and had the server control times to machines that way.  However, some computers will go into a dormant state, I would say this dormant state affects 20% of the machines.  No this dormant state is not sleep mode and not hibernation.  The computers are on and they are react very quickly to mouse movement.  I created a service that writes the time to a file on the C:\\ and this has always worked.  So now I have decided to have a service on the client machine and have it communicate with the server.\n\nI have collected very little information about creating service and network socket programming.  Unfortunately, I haven’t found anything that ties the 2 together.  I found a vb.net client-server program that does what I want, but I want it as a service not a program.  I found a temporary solution with creating files using PSEXEC from the server, but this process is just so umm unsophisticated.\n\nI did the next best thing and I went and reviewed the Microsoft library for sockets and tried to build my own service based on what makes sense.  Still nothing works.  If you know of any books, resources, have any advice, etc. any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your assistance.\n\nBelow you will find my code.  At this point all I care about doing is making the connections between clients and the server.

What other crypto primitives can you build out of that stream cipher?  In particular, are there any practical ways to build a cryptographic hash function and/or a MAC out of just a stream cipher?\n\n\nWe already have questions about turning a hash into a stream cipher and about turning a stream cipher into a block cipher, but this particular transformation doesn't seem to have been covered yet.\n\nObviously, if the platform constraints permit it, one could ignore the stream cipher and just implement a standard hash function from the ground up.  What I'm wondering is whether having the stream cipher available might let one do better than that in terms of code size, memory usage and/or speed.\n\nWhile a construction that treats the stream cipher as a black box would be nice, schemes that only use parts of the stream cipher (like RC4-Hash, which, alas, has practical collision attacks) would be interesting too, at least if they're simple enough.\n # of connections: 1","I have very complex model.

Do i have to change the sid or run newsid?\n\nJust looking for some best practices.\nthanks in advance.\ngd\n # of connections: 1","I have this code of server.js, I am really new to this.\nI try to get what the html form send to node.js server (localhost)\n\nserver.js\n\n//initialing the website\n\n\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\napp.get('/',function(req, res){//get,put,post,delete   \n\nres.sendFile('C:\\\\work\\\\translator\\\\startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3\\\\index.html');\napp.use(\"/css\", express.static(__dirname + '/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3/css'));\napp.use(\"/img\", express.static(__dirname + '/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3/img'));\napp.use(\"/font-awesome\", express.static(__dirname + '/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3/font-awesome'));\napp.use(\"/js\", express.static(__dirname + '/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3/js'));\napp.use(\"/less\", express.static(__dirname + '/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3/less'));\napp.use(\"/mail\", express.static(__dirname + '/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3/mail'));\napp.use(\"/fonts\", express.static(__dirname + '/startbootstrap-freelancer-1.0.3/fonts'));\n    });\n\n\nvar server = app.listen(3000, function () {\n\n  var host = server.address().address;\n  var port = server.address().port;\n\n  console.log('Example app listening at http://%s:%s', host, port);\n\n});\n\n\n//sending mail with gmail\n\n\napp.post('/contact', function (req, res) { \n\nvar nodemailer = require('nodemailer');\nvar transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({\n\n    service: 'gmail',\n    auth: {\n        user: 'my_email',\n        pass: 'my_password'\n    }\n});\n\n  transporter.sendMail({\n    from:  'user@email.com',\n    to: 'myemail@email.com',\n    subject: 'contact',\n    text:  'hello world'\n});\n });\n\n\nThe Html form\n\n&lt;form name=\"sentMessage\" action=\"/contact\" method=\"post\" id=\"contact\" novalidate&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" name=\"name\"&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"email\" class=\"form-control\" name=\"email\"&gt;\n&lt;input type=\"tel\" class=\"form-control\" name=\"phone\"&gt;\n&lt;textarea rows=\"5\" class=\"form-control\" name=\"message\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n&lt;button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-success btn-lg\"&gt;send&lt;/button&gt;\n\n\nI tried req.params, req.body.email and all kind of things to get the email in the email field but it says: \"email undefiend\", it's seems that somehow the server.js doesn't get the values/ parameters or something...\n # of connections: 1","Currently in Khojand, Tajikistan and wanting to take a taxi or something tomorrow to Dushanbe.

That sort of question, however, I could answer by simply opening the book and finding the definition.\n\nOn the other hand, merely knowing the definition of the term does not give me an indication of its significance: what is special/desirable (or undesirable) about a given attack being a Basic Attack?

I have tried using the following software:\n\n\nWindows photo gallery - and this appears to rapidly retrieve photos from the NAS based on chose tag words. The main down side that I have found so far is that the windows camera codec does not yet support my S95 RAW files and so they are not visible. \nPicasa – this looks as though it might work well on a local drive (and certainly get good reviews) but I am finding it very slow when scanning the photo library on the NAS (even when left for a number of hours the scan in only approx. 5% complete!). I can live with a bit of a delay when using the NAS but this is unworkable - am I getting something wrong?\nVarious other photo viewers - Although they allow me to see my RAW files do not appear to support tagging and the development of a cross referenced library. \n\n\nI am also considering looking at getting Lightroom but don’t want to shell out the money only to find it is as slow as Picasa.\n\nFinally, my ideal would be to have different layers of tags so for example I could tag all my pictures from the “Lake District” but then also have the option of sub dividing within this category based on the valley etc. Without different levels of tagging I risk winding up with an unwieldy list of tag words.

The datagridview on the other hand works like a charm...\n\nDoes anyone have an idea?\n # of connections: 1","I need to create custom webpart with complex (few divs, or other html elements) background and borders. \n\nHow can i use default sharepoint content editor and just add predefined background and frame!?\n\nThanks.\n # of connections: 1","I was googling quite a lot for this question, but I couldn't find an answer.

Then they divide the all values (treated and controls) each with controls.\nOn the other hand I found another way to normalize that follows this steps: $\\text{Efficiency}^{(CT_{\\large\\text{control}} - CT_{\\large\\text{treated}})}$.

This is a problem for Protractor, because it wants to wait for all outstanding HTTP requests to finish.\n\nI see a number of potential solutions, but have some issues with all of them.\n\nI do not see a way to tell Protractor to ignore this request. Issuing it from $interval (which itself is ignored) is not a solution. Protractor will not wait for the request to be sent, but once it's sent, it will still wait for it to complete.\n\nSo I'm trying not to send this request when running the tests. But how do I know I'm in a test?\n\n\nI could add a flag to the URL (?protractor=true). But my web app modifies the URL all the time, so it would get cleared quickly.\nI tried setting a variable: browser.executeScript('window.runningProtractorTests = true;'); But it seems Protractor will wait for the page to sync first before running executeScript. And I'm sending the request right away when the page loads.\nI could set a cookie. But it's fairly cumbersome, e.g. I'd have to load the page twice. (See issue 341 for more difficulties.)\nI could set a user agent. It's not easy either. I would need to set browser flags for each browser in the config file. I do not want to completely override the user agent (to Protractor, for example) out of fear that my libraries may rely on interpreting the user agent string, so I'd have to figure out the right string.\nI could check if the server is running on a specific port. But then a year from now someone will try to run the production server on the same port and not understand why the notifications don't work.\nMaking the test backend complete the request immediately does not help, because it's immediately sent again whenever it completes. But I guess I could introduce a special \"you are in a test\" notification and stop the polling when this is received. This would mean a (small) change to our protocol, so I'd rather avoid it if possible.\n\n\nIs there no straightforward way to do this?\n # of connections: 1","I have two views, one above another as a child.\nView1--->View2 (View1 has View2 as a child)\n\nHow can I code this functionality?\n1) if user TAPed on View2 - so the proper message tapped: sent to View2;\n2) if user just moving finger over the View1(including View2) - events passed to View1 so it can handle touchesBegan: and so on. \n\nSo what I am trying to code is make one function \"[View2 tapped:...]\" if touch was short, and another function([View1 touchesBegan:..] and so on) if touch is moving.\n\nIn my case if I move finger over View2 - it never passes events to View1.\n\nP.s.

Is there a more suitable name?\nWhen the user inputs which row and column to place an X or O in, I made it so that the coordinates they enter are from 1 to the number of rows and not 0 to the number of rows minus one (like with zero-based array indexing). Is this more user-friendly, or should I change it to zero-based indexing?\nIn PSPlayer.m, I use nested ternary operators. Is this too hard to understand?

I can't find any info on the internet and so am here, although this might have been a good place to start.\n\nI've recently developed an encryption engine using the .net's AES managed classes. I use a 256 bit key generated by the Rfc2898DeriveBytes function. The key is generated from a pass phrase that is at least 40 characters long. The IV is also generated from this pass phrase. The encryption class uses a CypherMode of CBC and a padding mode of PKCS7. There is a static salt that is 8 bytes long. \n\nThe key is stored in a separate database to the data and is itself encrypted using a certificate based on the database master key.\n\nSo, my question is: is it really easy to decrypt the data if the attacker has the key? I'm not talking about the Chinese government (or even GHCQ given recent headlines), I'm talking about an attacker who steals both databases. \n\nWhat would be the steps they have to follow and/or how can I stop them on their path? The reason I ask this is that I want to know how feasible it is. Is it something that can be done in minutes or does it fall into the bracket of being infeasible?

The project works like this: The end user can access a webapp using a link and he can add multiple systems on his network and manage that particular systems details. My part involves the front end and the webserver, which is done in python. My python actually communicates with another project which is entirely done in c &amp; c++. The c/c++ project is the main app which does all the functionality. My python sends the user request to it and displays the response from it to the user. \n\nI am very familiar with my work and I will finish it soon. Since that's not much work in it. And I am a person who loves to work. I spends most of the time in office and only go home when I feel sleepy.\n\nThe c/c++ app is managed by another colleague who has 5+ year experience and can do things much faster than me, but he never does it. May be he doesn't like to do it. His app crashes often when my python communicate with it or returns wrong values. It's full of bugs. Since my app depends on it, I am having a hard time building it. Instead of fixing the bugs, he asks me to slow down my work. He asks me to tell manager that my work needs a lot of time. He is asking me to fool the manager and even forcing me to work slowly like him.\n\nDuring project meeting, when manager asks him about the bugs he says that he fixed everything and it works fine. Since he is my colleague, I couldn't tell anything to the manager. I obviously need to have a good relationship with my colleagues more than my manager, since most of the time we will be with our colleagues, not with the manager.\n\nI am not able to tell the manager anything regarding this, since if manager asks him why, then he may think I complained about him to the manager. And he keeps on lying in the meeting. And since he fixes the bug slowly, it even slows down my work. Now I thought of working on the front-end part of my app  and finishing it off so that in the mean time he can make his project stable. Now he is asking me to tell the manager that my front end part require a lot of work and I may need more and more time, simply so that he can drag the project down. And the sad thing is our actual manager has gone to the US, so we have a temporary manager and this guy doesn't know about the project much, so the c,c++ just fools him.\n\nCan anyone suggest me how I deal with this?\nI wanted to finish off the project soon. How can I make him work even by maintaining a good relationship with him?\n\nResponses to comments:\n\n\n  If he's really deliberately misleading the company, you should report him to management.\n\n\nI am new to this company and the other guy has been there for many years. And I have just started knowing my colleagues. If I directly go and complaint him, I don't think so I can make good relationship with my other colleagues. Even he has the power to mislead them. I am not telling he is a bad guy, he can do the work, but he is not doing it.\n\n\n  Doesn't your company have any kind of bug tracking system ? \n\n\nHere actual bug tracking system isn't there. The company tries to finish off the project as soon as possible and gives it to the QA. And then fixes the bugs reported by QA. \n\n\n  This is why companies should give employees stock / options or some sort of ownership. That way you can literally tell the guy \"You are costing me monetary growth... don't you want to make money also?\".\n\n\nThe company has the stock options they have given me a 2500 share, mostly he too would have got some more.\n\n\n  Seniority does deserve some benefit of a doubt. You really need to speak to him first and try to understand the problem. He may be out of his depth, you may be able to help him, there could easily be variables you are unaware of. It may be hard now, but you could easily make the situation a lot worse by jumping the gun. \n\n\nI even does it, first his app wasn't handling multiple requests at a time, he was using a queue to handle the requests I sent to him. I even suggested to him some of my ideas on it. He said he already had these ideas, and will be executing them. His explanations was: \"Everything require certain time to do and this is a project which may need two years to complete and we are asked to finish it in two months\". I used to have a hard time coding during first few weeks because of this bug. But now he fixed it. But he is using a single queue for a user requests and that is now slowing down the app, since it processes one request at a time.\n\n\n  What is QA doing this whole time? Why aren't they reporting/confirming the status of the project(s)? \n\n\nThe manager is the person who decides when to give to the QA. As of now it has not yet given to QA. He said we should give it by this month end. \n # of connections: 1","I am using a jQuery plugin called iScroll 4 (iScroll4 Docs), which allows me to touch, swipe, pinch and scroll a scrolling panel.

Who uses them? And why?\n\nAre they doing something special apart from going to the local authoritative body and performing a title search on a parcel id number?\n\nA) Am I paying them just so they can do my due dilligence and then stamp some big ole company seal on the documents they provided me with? So I feel more confident in the documentation provided?\n\nB) Do they exist solely to service large banks and corporations who control thousands of property deeds worldwide and cannot afford to pay a staffer in every single city on earth just to perform title searches?\n\nC) Or might they exist for some other reason that I am entirely unaware of?\n\nI am not trying to be facetious. I am genuinely curious. As somebody who has never looked into the process of acquiring land in the past, they seem to be redundant as a service. I can't imagine how so many of them are still in business.\n\n\n\nTake Detroit, MI for example.\n\nThere is a website called https://www.waynecountylandrecords.com (which is run by the city of Detroit) where I can go and pay them $6 for 15 minutes of access to perform as many property title searches as I can manage in 15 minutes. It costs $2 per page to print (download) documents from that database, up to a maximum of $10 per document.\n\nThat, or I could physically visit the land records office listed on their website and do the same thing in person. Although it would cost me a bit more money I believe.\n\n\n\nSo again my question is why would I spend more money with a title search company as opposed to performing the title search myself?\n\nIs it simply because \"performing a title search\" requires the ability to circumnavigate a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo or even know where to perform the title search in the first place? I am quite distraught over the (what seem to me to be) unnessary complications involved in purchasing a property.\n\nI'll be frank. I create and maintain extremely large computer databases for a living. So the idea of paying somebody $25+ to basically extract data from a database and then pass it on to me seems asinine.\n\nThe sole fact that a city like Detroit Michigan is placing a pay wall of $6 to even perform an online title search seems ludicrous to me as well. Seeing as it's in their best interest to give potential investors full and complete knowledge of any liens on the literally thousands of properties they are in need of having purchased by tax-paying individuals. For what? A few $100k in annual revenue for the City?

And here is the disagreement:\n\nHis point of view: Since Zzzax has Intangibility d10, he ignores all physical attacks, the only way to defeat him is to activate his Limit and then over-complicate him. He activated the Limit because my roll was so high that it should have a result. He still has Intangibility even though his Power Set is shut down.\n\nMy point of view: Activating a Limit doesn't allow you to randomly ignore an attack. I can't ignore an attack and become Exhausted instead. Intangibility is just a die to add to Reaction rolls, not an automatic effect that allows you to ignore everything, that requires an SFX like Immunity(Physical attacks).\n\nI went with his interpretation (and built a Faraday cage through web and pipes), but I still think that it was not right.\n\nSo how does Intangibility work? Is it an automatic effect, even without Immunity/Invulnerability SFXs, or is it just a resistance, allowing you to be attacked normally?\n # of connections: 1","I've got a tinyows on localhost that works fine (both through browser GetFeature and QGIS).

However, this solution requires too many gates (a 4-input NOR minimum). My previous design was actually fed from another part in the design that is already present, so it didn't require any additional circuitry. \n\nAny ideas on a more efficient solution?  \n\n\n\n\nThe IC's used in this design are the 74LS47 (7Segment decoder) and the 74LS163 (4-bit binary counter).

Why a 4 sided die for one thing, three 6 sided dice for another, and a twenty sided dice for something else? Couldn't you use, just for example, two 10 sided dice to represent a percentage between 1 and 100 (one die is tens and the other is ones, and they're differentiated by colour), and then use that for all instances?\n\nIf you needed to decide something was a one in four possibility, you just declare it a 25% chance, and roll the two tens. No matter what kind of possibility you wanted that are currently represented by various combinations of dice, it seems to me you could represent it within a range of one to one hundred. \n\nSure, a bag of all different shaped dice looks kind of cool, but is there a reason for them that goes beyond aesthetics? With just two 10 sided dice (or three if you wanted really fine gradients of percentage) wouldn't that make things simpler and more consistent without losing any of the variety of chances taken?\n\nI thought maybe it had to do with probabilistic outcomes. For instance, if you roll two 6 sided dice, I believe that you're more likely to come up with some combination that adds up to 7 than you are with a combination that adds up to 2 or 12. So there's a bell curve of possible outcomes. Nonetheless, maybe I'm just not well versed enough in probabilities enough to see a difference, but I still think you could get the same equivalent likelihoods of an outcome by using a straight percentage, adjusting up or down depending on what you needed.\n\nAgain, I'm not trying to be contrarian, I'm just curious. Is there an objective reason for all the different dice?\n # of connections: 1","\n  Possible Duplicate:\n  ICS Android enable gps programmatically?

A Descriptor has all of the properties that are needed by the various types of instances. It has properties that drive behavior, what it looks like on screen, and so on.\n\nSo here's the part that bothers me:\n\nEverything... EVERYTHING, from Atlas to TerrainInstance can talk up and down the entire chain, the reason being that if, for example, the TerrainInstance is a square upon which a player steps and suddenly a number of monsters are conjured around him, the TerrainInstance needs to have access to the neighboring LayerCells.  Or for another example if a CreatureInstance when attacking the player's CreatureInstance is able to take items from the player's inventory, and relocate them somewhere else in the dungeon, it needs access to a different Layer or AtlasCell in order to put the item where it needs to go.\n\nAn alternative that would appear to be \"better encapsulated\" might be a messaging system that sends little message objects up and down the chain and handles things at the appropriate level, but is that really any BETTER than just having the objects be aware of one another?\n\nThe game I'm writing started out with mostly hardcoded item and creature types, and gradually morphed its way into something similar to the more flexible roguelike framework that I've detailed above. I'm finally switching from C# to Java for it(the language is immaterial, however), and I'd like to not have missed something glaringly obvious that will cause great pains later when I need to refactor it.\n\nSo, the question: is the apparent lack of encapsulation within the data/business objects of the game demonstrate a fatal flaw in the architecture?

Let me quote from an answer:\n\n\n  In my experience, in UK and other European countries, the research\n  funding comes from successful proposals to the relevant funding\n  bodies. There are research centres that were established and keep\n  going only because the staff there constantly submits project\n  proposals (somebody told me that the success rate is 1 out of 5 or\n  maybe even lower).\n\n\nThere are two questions here.\n\n\nCan a company feasibly focus on obtaining funds in publicly funded research (as a business model) successfully enough to \"survive\"?\nCan such a company be started (nearly) from scratch?\n\n\nIn short, the company would be exactly like a research institute (or institution) except that it would be private.\n\nReasons why question 1 may not be feasible:\n\n\nI don't see any company doing this kind of thing, i.e. there may be some, but there are not many, which means that it may be hard. It's a bad sign.\nPublic funds seem to be assigned to public entities, while companies can benefit from the collaboration and synergy, but they are expected to get their funding from their work as companies (searching for customers, etc.) In this case the customers would be the partners in the projects and the society itself, but again, this seems to be an \"innovative\" (maybe naïve, or even plain stupid) idea.\nResearch is a means for something, not an end on itself, that's why the business model should be on something else (point two) and that's why such a company would raise eyebrows on the mere idea of its existence. It may even be against some kind of tacit rule or even written laws.\n\n\nReasons why question 2 may not be feasible:\n\n\nNo previous history of success of the company, or products or anything means zero (or negative) trustworthiness and no projects assigned to the company.\nNo partners would like to associate with the company in a project for the reasons in point 1.\nThe most similar case I can think of are spin-off companies that are created from successful research labs, not from scratch.\nOMG so much communism! Go to kickstarter you hippie!\n\n\nAs an example, a possible scenario that could be close to this: Someone writes a paper about a software system that does something not very novel in the state of the art but in a way that is very different from an architectural point of view, leading to good results in practical terms.

What is done remains the same in theory, but how it is done is completely different in practice (and now it works).

Using ILSpy I see that the code compiles to this.\n\nnum = Program.bar&lt;int&gt;(new Func&lt;int, bool&gt;(Program.foo));\nnum = Program.bar&lt;int&gt;(new Func&lt;int, bool&gt;(Program.foo));\nnum = Program.bar&lt;int&gt;((int i) =&gt; true);\n\n\nI don't understand why the compiler can't infer the type from the fact that I only have one function called foo, and it does fit the template so to speak. Now if I had created another function bool foo(bool i) I would understand if the compiler complained that there was some ambiguity and it didn't know which one I wanted and that I should specify the type argument explicitly.\n\nThis of course is just me being lazy, but it is just something I was expecting and was surprised when the compiler wasn't picking up my slack.\n # of connections: 1","At my new job, we have multiple named instances on each servers. \n\n\nServer1\\Dev \nServer1\\DevIntegrated \nServer1\\QA\n\n\nI have a SQL PowerShell script in the works that calls out to the OS, invokes Foo.exe but needs to pass a command line parameter (the connection string).

Research indicated the PowerShell listed under SQL Agent was SQLPS and starting an instance of it by right clicking on the Agent automagically dropped me into the correct location. It was only when I pasted my interactive code into the job step that I learned of the difference as previously mentioned.\n\nJob type of OS put me into an identical state in that I could not find a way to determine which instance dropped me into the command shell.

However, for various reasons, the process remains difficult to implement or troubleshoot for lack of even abstracted examples, or maybe too abstracted. And there's a few \"can not do\" posts, nearly always followed up by \"with 3.5, you now can\" caveats, so whether one can remains ambiguous, though no doubt non-trivial.\n\nSummary:\n\nHow to move a wordpress multisite (WPMS) from root.com to root/blogs?\n\nFor this example, we're moving a WPMS from \"root.com\" to \"root.com/blogs\"\n\nI understand that I need to update the paths in the database and wp-config.php appropriately. It seems I may also have to update .htaccess? I'm also aware of the serialization issue with search/replace and mysql query updates.\n\nI have a WPMS that I've updated to 3.5. I've found the following tables with domain and path info\n\nExisting working configuration before move to subdirectory\n\n1. wp_blogs\n\nselect blog_id, domain, path from wp_blogs;\n+---------+-------------+--------+\n| blog_id | domain      | path   |\n+---------+-------------+--------+\n|       1 | root.com    | /      |\n|       2 | root.com    | /matt/ |\n+---------+-------------+--------+\n\n\n2. wp_site\n\nselect * in wp_site;\n+----+-------------+------+\n| id | domain      | path |\n+----+-------------+------+\n|  1 | root.com    | /    |\n+----+-------------+------+\n\n\n3. The blog_id corresponds to the wp_#_options tables which contain:\n\nselect option_name,option_value from wp_2_options \nwhere option_name = 'home' or option_name = 'siteurl';\n+-------------+--------------------------+\n| option_name | option_value             |\n+-------------+--------------------------+\n| home        | http://root.com/matt/    |\n| siteurl     | http://root.com/matt/    |\n+-------------+--------------------------+\n\n\n4. In my wp-config.php I have the following WPMS-specific lines:\n\ndefine('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true);\ndefine( 'MULTISITE', true );\ndefine( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', false);\n$base = '/';\ndefine( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'root.com' );\ndefine( 'PATH_CURRENT_SITE', '/' );\ndefine( 'SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );\ndefine( 'BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );\n\n\n5. Lastly, in my .htaccess, I have:\n\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /\nRewriteRule ^index\\.php$ - [L]\n\n# uploaded files\nRewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?files/(.+) wp-includes/ms-files.php?file=$2 [L]\n\n# add a trailing slash to /wp-admin\nRewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?wp-admin$ $1wp-admin/ [R=301,L]\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d\nRewriteRule ^ - [L]\nRewriteRule  ^[_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/(wp-(content|admin|includes).*) $1 [L]\nRewriteRule  ^[_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/(.*\\.php)$ $1 [L]\nRewriteRule . index.php [L]\n\n\nUpdates required to move the site\n\nIt seems to me that in order to move my site to the /blogs , I would:\n\n1. Update wp_blogs to\n\nmysql&gt; update wp_blogs set domain=concat(domain, '/blogs'), path=concat(path, 'blogs/');\nselect blog_id, domain, path from wp_blogs where blog_id &lt; 3;\n+---------+-------------+--------------+\n| blog_id | domain      | path         |\n+---------+-------------+--------------+\n|       1 | root.com    | /blogs/      |\n|       2 | root.com    | /blogs/matt/ |\n+---------+-------------+--------------+\n\n\n2. Update wp_site to\n\nupdate wp_site set domain=concat(domain, '/blogs'), path=concat(path, 'blogs/');\nselect * from  wp_site;\n+----+-------------+------------+\n| id | domain      | path       |\n+----+-------------+------------+\n|  1 | root.com    | /blogs/    |\n+----+-------------+------------+\n\n\n3. wp_#_options\n\n+-------------+--------------------------------+\n| option_name | option_value                   |\n+-------------+--------------------------------+\n| home        | http://root.com/blogs/matt/    |\n| siteurl     | http://root.com/blogs/matt/    |\n+-------------+--------------------------------+\n\n\n4. wp_config.php\n\ndefine('WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true);\ndefine( 'MULTISITE', true );\ndefine( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', false);\n$base = '/blogs/';\ndefine( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'root.com' );\ndefine( 'PATH_CURRENT_SITE', '/blogs/' );\ndefine( 'SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );\ndefine( 'BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );\n\n\nnote: I'm not clear how this step is appropriately updated\n\n5. .htaccess\n\nI found vague \"update .htaccess appropriately\" instructions, but not specifics. Update RewriteBase? Which lines in .htaccess to I update when I move root.com to root.com/blogs?\n\nMissing from the above process will be the paths founds in posts. My druthers are to use the search and replace tool for that, after I've made this more fundamental updates; or am I wrong?\n\nUpdate bungeshea suggests that, yes, I point RewriteBase to the \"blogs\" subdirectory, i.e.,\n\nRewriteBase /Blogs\n\n\nFinally, if you don't know about http://interconnectit.com/products/search-and-replace-for-wordpress-databases/ you should.

I have ONE action per Button, maybe named: ACTION_PLAYER_JUMP as an enumValue, and when I am in a GameScene this is okay, but in a MenuScene this ACTION_PLAYER_JUMP is not a very nice name... I do not want to have all bindings two times, just for better names.\n\nCan someone tell me how to fix this, or a better system? I am sure there is a much better system for handling those bindings.\n # of connections: 1","I hope you can help me.

Once it drops, it goes down to 10-500 records/s. With the default settings, the drop happens after around a million records. Looking at the documentation, that is the default number of buckets in the array, so it makes sense. I increased this number to 25 millions and indeed, it works fine until around 25 millions records. Problem is, as soon as I push the number of buckets to 30 millions or over, the insert rate is down to 10-500 records/s from the beginning. Kyoto Cabinet is not designed to increase the number of bucket after the database is created, so I cannot insert more than 25 millions records.\n\n1/ Why would KC's insert rate get very low once the bucket number exceeds 25M ?\n\nWith Berkeley DB: The best speed I got is slightly lower than KC, closer to 50000 record/s, but still ok. With the default settings, just like KC, the speed drops suddenly after around a million records. I know BDB is designed to extend gradually its number of buckets. Regardless of that, It tried to increase the initial number, playing with HashNumElements and FillFactor, but any of these attempts made the situation worst. So I still cannot insert over 1-2 millions records with DBD. I tried activating non-synchronized transactions, tried different rates of checkpoints, increased caches. Nothing improves the drop down.\n\n2/ What could cause BDB's insert rate to drop after 1-2 million inserts ?\n\nNote: I'm working with java, and when the speed is dropping, the CPU usage lowers to 0-30% while at 100% when working at correct speed.\nNote: Stopping the process and resuming the insertion changes nothing.

Okay I understand, both objects attract each other.\n\nIf two cars of different masses collide doesn't the car with less mass accelerate more even though both cars received the same Force. Then that implies you need more force to accelerate a large mass than to accelerate a small mass.

She tempted me to eat the apple.\n  (transitive) To attract; to allure. Its glossy skin tempted me.\n  (transitive) To provoke something; to court. It would be tempting fate.\n  \n\n\nBut, as with many secular concepts that overlap religious concepts, there are often explicit theological definitions which allow the terminology to fit into religious, dogmatic, and theological discussions with less ambiguity. In this case, is there any predominating Christian/theological definition?\n\nIn particular, how is temptation defined or explained in such a manner that allows Christ to have been tempted?\n\nTo clarify the problem, if Christ is to be attracted to some thing, there must be some part or aspect of Christ to which some thing appeals. More significantly, Christ, in order to be tempted, must desire that thing if we are to say He is attracted to it. And if Christ is to contain a part or aspect to which some evil may be a temptation, thus arousing a desire, there could be said to be a sinful nature or component in Christ -- a contradiction of His Godliness.\n\nTo illustrate the problem, one might select magnetism (or any natural force) as a natural analogy. For the effect of magnetism (sin) to attract (tempt) a material (person), the material must contain, at least to some extent, a magnetic (sinful) component.\n\nThus, if we say that Christ is tempted in this understanding, we say that He has a sinful component.\n\nHow do we Christians, Catholics, or any denomination that has a well-established concept, define or explain temptation in a non-trivial manner without requiring Christ to have a sinful nature?\n # of connections: 1","I want to create 2 or more than 2 two button in android but I got the problem in this line \n\nView btnClick = findViewById(R.id.buttonClick);\n    View btnscan = findViewById(R.id.btscanClick);\n    //set event listener\n    btnClick.setOnClickListener(this);\n}\n\n//override the OnClickListener interface method\n@Override\npublic void onClick(View arg0) {\n    if(arg0.getId() == R.id.buttonClick){\n        //define a new Intent for the second Activity\n        Intent intent = new Intent(this,SecondActivity.class);\n        //start the second Activity\n        this.startActivity(intent);\n\npublic void onClick1(View arg1) {\n    if(arg1.getId() == R.id.btscanClick){\n        //define a new Intent for the second Activity\n        Intent intent = new Intent(this,ScanActivity.class);\n        //start the second Activity\n        this.startActivity(intent);\n\n # of connections: 1","Don’t get me wrong in the beginning of reading this. I really mean the label and not the content of FAQ. The content is very useful if its’ made the right way (as here on ux.se), but there are plenty of examples where it isn’t. The real question concerns the label which is a convention I’d like to challenge.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1647 Matthew Hopkins wrote The Discovery of Witches which were introduced as \"Certain Queries answered\" and had the form of a list of Question and Answer, even if the topic is inappropriate by today’s standards. The label FAQ origins from the early 1980s mailing lists where NASA hoped to get new users read the old mail conversations, which were not the case. Instead the same questions were answered again and again and the need for FAQ was born. The acronym FAQ was invented by Eugene Miya and FAQ were later used in mail on a weekly basis at first and later on as a daily mail.\n\n\n  Today FAQ is more frequently used to refer to the list, and a text consisting of questions and their answers is often called an FAQ regardless of whether the questions are actually frequently asked, if they are asked at all.[1]\n\n\nProblem\n\nAcronyms are generally bad, since it excludes those who do not know the meaning. They either have to search for the acronym, if they are interested, or just ignore it. If a label is ignored, there is not much use of it and an entire section of valid content is lost by bad labeling. However, it is a very strong web convention which might lead to confusion over time for experienced users.\nAlso the original meaning have changed (see quote), which also implies that the label would be wrong.\n\nQuestion\n\nIsn’t the FAQ label obsolete by now? and if so How do we relabel it to suit both experienced and new users?\n\n\n\nEdit: I’d really like to know why we can or cannot change the label FAQ. Current answer does not meet that criterion.\n\n[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAQ\n # of connections: 1","Starting four days ago, I wasn't able to open any of the icons at the bottom of the page of my MacBook.

I would place transients at falling clock edges, that way both Tsu and Th time for sampling are clear. (Somewhat similar to SPI bus behavior.)\n\nWhat see in a datasheet of a real world device (74595): D flipflops connected in series having a common clock. At the output of the first flipflop, transient on the data line follows rising clock edge with Tpd. The next flipflop needs Th time stable data line after rising edge to operate correctly. Of course it works because Tpd>Th, but it's only a matter of nanoseconds.\n\nMy problem with all this is that it's not robust (maybe not the best word). Visualizing stuff on a logic analyzer will be less useful because data lines practically change in sync with clock rising edge. Random errors caused by Th>Tpd are not really visible and go undetected. If I connect another shift register in series from a different technology, which requires longer hold times, the circuit won't work, no matter how slow clock I chose.\n\nIs this the way most commonly synchronous digital circuits are constructed?

The domain was created and promoted succesfully and I was able to log on into the domain from a client machine.\n\nThe issue began when I realized that I was no longer able to log on locally into the server (meaning LOCALMACHINE\\localusername). I looked into domain user accounts and noticed that the local user accounts I created previously were now part of the domain. I consider a bad thing not being able to log on locally anymore, so in a shot to fix it I stopped the Active Directory service... my bad! Now I'm sort of locked up, I can't log either locally or as part of the domain.\n\nCan someone please shed some light in this? What did I miss in the process?

Each student must indicate his/her grading preference for each course within the first 2 weeks of the term. Most departments have a strict requirement that all \"required\" courses must be taken for a letter grade; however, elective courses can either be taken for a letter grade or Pass/Fail. Many of these elective courses are advanced versions of \"required\" courses, or they might be intermediate to advanced courses in other departments that are still related to one's research area.\n\nWhen it comes time to apply for postdoc or junior faculty positions, could choosing to take elective courses Pass/Fail negatively impact hiring or funding decisions? For example, suppose a postdoc advertisement states that the position requires knowledge of a technique or area covered in an elective course. Would the fact that an applicant received a \"Pass\" in the course be considered the same as if the grade was instead an A or B? Alternatively, is it better to risk getting a B (or C) in a hard elective course instead of \"playing it safe\" by electing to Pass/Fail the course (where A, B, and C all get the same grade)? Are there any situations where the choice between letter grade vs. Pass/Fail can impact anything negatively or positively?\n\nI've often heard that grades don't matter as much in graduate school compared to things like research output and networking, which may make this question a bit irrelevant. Still, I would be curious what others think.\n # of connections: 1","I have a database on access and I want to add a value to a column at the end of each row based on which hospital they are in.

Similarly, for a byte which is 8 bits, the maximum number of different assignments would be 2^8.\n\nIs there a name for this number?\n\nWhen we pass everything through our system that has ECMAScript, Java and MySQL, then a boolean does not have only two possible assignments. For instance, a false boolean gets saved as a 0 and the boxed value could be null so a boolean suddenly can get true, false, 0, 1, null or even undefined or &lt;missing&gt;.\n\nI think it could get problematic in tests to guarantee that the values are not inconsistent. For instance, a value boolean locked could become null and then when a script or a layout template evaluates it then it will evaluate to false somewhere if the real value was null and similar problems.\n\nSo why don't we always assert that a boolean has the same number of possible values (2 values) and similarly for other types?\n\nThere is a mathematical term named \"arity\" that is something similar but not exactly, and statistics and probability theory also has the concept of \"event space\" that would be almost exactly what I mean. For instance, the event space for a boolean would be the set {0,1} which has cardinality 2 and that cardinality doesn't get preserved throughout the system, especially when data is passed as polyglots and/or serialized (json, jsonp, xml, yaml).\n # of connections: 1","Proposition 1.11 in Atiyah-Macdonald's \"Introduction to commutative algebra\" states the following: \n\n\"Given an ideal $I$ in a ring $A$ and $p_1, \\dots p_n$ prime ideals, then $I \\subset \\cup_i p_i$ implies that $I\\subset p_j$ for some $j\\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}.$ \"\n\nThis is clearly equivalent to saying that \"if $I$ is not a subset of $p_i$ for any $i,$ then $I$ is not a subset of $\\cup_i p_i.$\" \n\nBut they then claim that this last statement is logically equivalent to the following: \n\n\"For each $i,$ there exists $x_i \\in I$ such that $x_i \\notin p_k$ for all $k\\neq i.$\" \n\nCan anyone help me to see why this statement is logically a consequence of the first?

I also know the function of the diode is to protect the transistor but from what exactly? Is it something to do with back EMF from the coil? I'm not too sure. Also I needed to confirm if the relay will function correctly with a 9V supply (regulated or unregulated). The datasheet of the relay is attached here and the part I'm going to use is '40.61' on page 20 of the datasheet.\n\nAlso any tips for making this circuit work more efficiently.

However, I am running into a little problem and would like a hint of how to proceed.\n\nIf A and B commute then $[A,B] = ABA^{-1}B^{-1} = e$ where e is the identity element of the group.\n\n$$\\therefore AB=BA$$\n\n$$n=1; [A,B^1] = (1)B^0[A,B] = e$$\nThis statement is certainly true. however moving on to $n = 2$ I find...\n\n$$[A,B^2] = AB^2A^{-1}B^{-2} = ABBA^{-1}B^{-1}B^{-1} = BBAA^{-1}B^{-1}B^{-1}$$\n\nWhere in the last step I have used the fact that A and B commute to rearange the terms. However, it is plain to see that this last term simply reduces to the identity as well and for the n = 2 case we have:\n\n$$[A,B^2] = e \\ne 2B[A,B] = 2Be = 2B$$\n\nClearly I have assumed something I shouldn't have.

Specifically, they pointed out that when one is proving the validity of a combinatorial identity by counting a set in two different ways, this is a different activity than giving an explicit bijection between two different sets.  However, in combinatorics we often use the phrases \"combinatorial proof\" and \"bijective proof\" as synonyms, and I have often heard people use the phrase \"bijective proof\" regarding a \"count in two different ways\" proof of an identity.\n\nIt seems to me that often a combinatorial proof arises from describing one set in two different ways; implicit in a proof of the equality of the two descriptions of this set is the identity bijection from the set to itself.  In this sense, one might regard all \"combinatorial\" proofs as \"bijective,\" but I feel that I am on quite shaky ground with this.  These thoughts have led me to the following questions:\n\nQuestion 1: What are some examples of combinatorial situations where the same set can be described in two different ways but it is not at all clear that the two descriptions yield the same object?\n\nQuestion 2: What are some examples of situations where two bijective proofs have been given for a theorem or identity where the bijections turned out to be the same, but proving their equivalence was non-trivial?\n\nI would also appreciate opinions regarding the distinction, if any, between combinatorial arguments where one proves identities by describing a set in two different ways and combinatorial arguments where one sets up bijections between genuinely different sets of objects.\n\nEDIT\n\nThanks for the answers and comments so far.  Here are two examples that will hopefully clarify what I am asking.  One example of a bijective proof between two different sets are showing that Dyck paths and nonnesting partitions are both Catalan-enumerated objects (even preserving the Narayana statistic with a good bijection).  On the other hand, the identity $\\sum_{k=0}^nk{n\\choose k}=n2^{n-1}$ is usually proved by describing $k$-subsets of $n$ with a distinguished element in two different ways: in the first way, pick the set then specify the element; in the second way, pick the element then specify the rest of the set.  These are both referred to as bijective or combinatorial proofs, yet somehow they each have a different feel to them.  In the second case, it is pretty easy to see that the two descriptions of these objects yield the same set of objects, but surely there must be more situations where the same set is described in two different ways and the equivalence of their descriptions is difficult to ascertain.  Similarly, there must be times where there are several bijections between different sets, like the first example, where the bijections are the same but not obviously so.  What I am wondering about are examples of these two situations.\n\nA non-combinatorial example of an answer to Q1 is the compact-group vs reflection group definition of the Weyl group of a semi-simple Lie Algebra, where it isn't immediately clear that the same group is obtained.  However, I am looking for more combinatorial examples.\n # of connections: 1","total newbie trying to work through the rails tutorial on lynda.com\n\nThe code is really short and exactly the way it is on the video, yet I can't get my page to render the partial.

At the time I did not notice an error in his work, and so the derivation provided in the paper is incorrect. I contacted my coauthors, included the (former) grad student. The other authors readily agreed to have their names on the errata paper, but the former grad student disagreed and feels that his work was without error. And so he said that he did not want his name on the errata. Contacting the journal that published the original paper, the editor is not willing to publish an errata paper in which the author list does not include the entire list of authors from the original paper.\n\nSo I'm stuck. I'm quite certain about the error, and frustrated with the former student's insistence on being correct. But now there is no way to get the errata into the literature. The journal editor suggested perhaps publishing the changes as a \"comment paper\", but comment papers are only allowed if written by someone other than one of the original authors. So that's no help either.

online game with around 10k players calculates a real time ranking of points when a certain event occurs. Events don't occur that often, around 1 time per minute. This ranking is kept in the cache for quick calculations, sorting and access.\n\nNow players can form groups and play against each other, but the scoring system is the same, only the ranking is based for the players in that group.\n\nAt first I created for every group a separate ranking, effectively having the same scores as the complete ranking, but with different positions in the ranking.\n\nThis is trivial because there are over 1.000 groups and every time an event occurs all the groups would have to be updated.\n\nSo what I did now is when the group ranking is requested take only the players that are in that group from the complete ranking and show them. The positions would have to be re-counted.\n\nThat re-counting is where the problem is. Because the sub-list is by-reference from the complete ranking list I cannot change the position of the player in the sub-ranking without updating it in the complete ranking, because it's just a reference.\n\nI came up with two solutions:\n\n\nCreate a copy from the record every time it is requested and do some output caching (not very desirable because the rankings are live)\nCreate a copy and store this in a cache which is reset when an event occurs.\nCreate a sub-list with just the positions which is updated when an event occurs.\n\n\nAnd the last solution: do the position counting in the output instead in the business side. This would be the best solution, only problem is that on some pages this text appears: \"You are on position # in the ranking\" where # is your ranking position. This number would be tedious to get then.\n\nDoes anybody have any suggestions to this problem?\n # of connections: 1","We're moving out of a flat in Paris next month and moving into another flat elsewhere in France at some indeterminate point between July and September after we travel for a while. \n\nIs there a way to avoid moving twice by renting a sealed trailer for an extended period, maybe leaving it with family elsewhere in France for a couple months? \n # of connections: 1","I was reading through Eloquent JavaScript, when I came across this in chapter 5. :\n\n\n  you can have functions that create new functions.\n\nfunction greaterThan(n) {\n  return function(m) { return m &gt; n; };\n}\nvar greaterThan10 = greaterThan(10);\n\n  \n  And you can have functions that change other functions.\n\nfunction noisy(f) {\n  return function(arg) {\n    console.log(\"calling with\", arg);\n    var val = f(arg);\n    console.log(\"called with\", arg, \"- got\", val);\n    return val;\n  };\n}\nnoisy(Boolean)(0);\n//-&gt;calling with 0\n//-&gt;called with 0 - got false\n\n\n\nMy questions are:\n\n\nHow are the above two examples different? \nHow does noisy change Boolean?\n\n # of connections: 1","I am practicing finding a side of an angle on Khan Academy.

This semester, in the same lecture hall there is another lecture that starts 20 minutes after my class ends. It's taught by another instructor from my department. I usually have many students coming to office hours and there are also students asking questions immediately after lecture. Due to other activities, I cannot have office hours right after the lecture this semester and can only stay for about 15 minutes to answer questions.\n\nMany times in the past I had a similar situation and never had any issues with it. This semester the instructor who is teaching right after often arrives 20-15 minutes before her class starts and tells me immediately that I have to go with my students somewhere else. \n\nI make sure to leave the blackboard clean and take all my stuff away from the instructor's desk before she arrives, but I do believe that I have a right to stay in the classroom after my lecture for at least 5-10 minutes. There is no vacant classroom around, and I don't have time to go with students to my office, which is in a different building.\n\nLast time the instructor told me in front of my students that I don't understand \"simple things\" and that I am \"playing games\". When I was talking to one of my students, she stood very close to us and clearly demonstrated that she wanted us out. I tried to explain her that I couldn't go anywhere else due to my time constraints, but she didn't want to listen to me. I really don't understand what \"simple\" things she meant and what \"games\" I am playing. \n\nWe leave the board clean. She doesn't need to set up a projector. She can still talk to her students before her class starts, if she wants to (even though it seems like her students don't ask her any questions before their class). So, I don't see how I cause any disruption. \n\nI had met this woman many times before this semester, but we never talked. I didn't see her talking to other instructors/students much, and she seems to be quite reserved and a bit neurotic. She doesn't want to have any conversation with me regarding the issue.\n\nI felt really offended after last class when she said those things to me in front of my students. What would you do in my case? \n\nAdded later: There are no official rules regarding classroom occupancy between classes. Instructors are supposed to use common sense and be reasonable. For me using 50% of the break time seems reasonable to answer questions after lecture seems reasonable. I agree that for some people it may not.\n\nI don't block the entrance to the classroom. A few students from the next class who come earlier always go ahead and take their seats as soon as my students start leaving the room. I also had one of the students from the next class listening to my explanation to one of those after-class questions and asking me further questions before their class (which is the same class as I am teaching, just a different section). Maybe the instructor got jealous, I don't know.\n\nThe entrance to the classroom is from its front (not back), so I do stay in the front. But it is a big lecture hall, and there is a plenty of space in front of the room (the board itself consists of 8 huge panels).\n\nAlso, during my career as a grad.student who is also teaching for the department, I have had several observations from experienced professors who are considered to be great teachers at the department and are in charge of undergraduate teaching policy. In my evaluations the fact that there are always several students approaching me with questions after class considered as very positive, meaning that students find me approachable. \n\nThank you everyone for answers. \n # of connections: 1","I have a WebForms app that uses a field validator on a dropdownlist.

Took it for light pacing at the store and things seemed OK. About 100 metres out the door, I shift up to the top end of the range, pedalling firmly but not hard, and it promptly throws the chain to the outside.\n\nReturning to the store, the mechanic puts the chain back on, adjusts the tension on the derailleurs and tells me not to use the top three or bottom two gears (i.e., the 3 highest resistance and two lowest resistance shift positions in the drive train's range), or the chain will throw again. I asked why, but unfortunately, I'm a foreigner and don't speak the local language well enough to understand any of his explanation. Please note I definitely did not misunderstand the bit about not using the gears; this was crystal clear. \n\nWild speculations on what he may have said about the reasons for this:\n\n\nChain tension or play due to the lateral shift between the inner and outer gears of the front and rear cassettes when shifting\nChain length\nSomething about the derailleurs\n\n\nAgain, there's a substantial language barrier and I have zero confidence in my understanding of what he said about why I shouldn't use those gears.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Decathlon, it's a sports department/box/super store. Definitely not a high end or dedicated bike shop. The house mechanic struck me as less than an expert, to put it gently. I've definitely read some reviews online griping about the inability of Decathlon staff to correctly set up the drive trains of new bikes. However, it's important to understand that this quality of expertise is representative of (or better than) that of every shop within an hour's travel.\n\nThis advice seems utterly mad to me. What on earth could be the reasoning behind this? What can I do about it? Aside from the obvious of taking it to a better mechanic, as that presents substantial difficulty for me on a number of fronts. The bike shifts without a problem, including before the throw. I did test out every gear during my test ride.

So if anyone can give some numbers based on their experience, that would help a lot.\n # of connections: 1","Is decoherence even possible in anti de Sitter space? The spatial conformal boundary acts as a repulsive wall, thus turning anti de Sitter space into an eternally closed quantum system. Superpositions remain superpositions and can never decohere. A closed system eventually thermalizes and undergoes Poincare recurrences. Whatever the dual is to an interacting conformal field theory, is it really a theory of quantum gravity, or does it only look like one superficially?\n # of connections: 1","A curve in Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$, $n \\geq 2$ is $analytic$ if the coordinates of its points $x= x_{1},...,x_{n}$ can be expressed as analytic functions of a real parameter $x_{i}=x_{i}(t)$, $i=1,...,n$ and $\\alpha \\leq t \\leq \\beta$ and the derivatives $x'(t_{0})$ do not simultaneously vanish for any $t_{0} \\in [\\alpha, \\beta]$.\nI search for a proof of the following fact:\n\nIf the set of intersection points of two analytic curves is infinite, then these curves coincide.\n\nCan we prove the same as above if we relax the condition that the coordinates are analytic to the condition that the coordinates belong to the class $C^{\\infty}$?\n\nEdit: Thanks to below remark by Ramiro, to obtain the above implication, we have to assume that any two curves $K_{1}, K_{2}$ as in the question are such that $K_{1} \\cap K_{2}$ is not another analytic curve.\n\n2nd edit: As suggested Peter, we can reformulate our question as follows:\n   Consider two immersed curves which are parameterized real analytically on compact intervals. If they have an infinite number of different intersection points, then their union is again a real analytic immersed curve. \n # of connections: 1","Why is the return type of std::count a ptrdiff_t?\n\nSince count can never be negative, isn't size_t technically the right choice? And what if the count exceeds the range of ptrdiff_t since the theoretical possible size of an array can be size_t?  \n\n\n\nEDIT: So far there is no suitable answer as to why the function returns ptrdiff_t. Some explanation gathered from the answers below is that the return type is iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt;::difference_type which is generic and can be anything. Up until that point it makes sense. There are cases where the count may exceed size_t. However, it still does not make sense why the return type is typedef ptrdiff_t iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt;::difference_type for the standard iterators instead of typedef size_t iterator_traits&lt;InputIterator&gt;::difference_type.\n # of connections: 1","I'm setting up a new machine (well actually, an Ubuntu VM) and am trying to write a script to setup a few common things that I use when doing this (Git, curl, vim + janus). \n\nSo my script looks a bit like this:\n\n#setup\n#!/bin/sh\nsudo apt-get install git\nsudo apt-get install curl\n...\n\n\nIt doesn't seem great to have 'sudo' mixed in with my command -- that is just my security-spidey-sense tingling.

I think we can definitively say that it hasn't worked out that way. I think the reason is reputation. If one person answer the question with 40% of the information that a comprehensive answer would contain, and another with another 40% with 20% scattered among three other answers. Who's answer will get edited with the combined information and get the further upvotes? It just doesn't happen. People don't want to edit questions and mess with someone else's reputation (quite rightly, IMO - how would you feel getting a downvote for something added to your answer that you didn't write?).\n\nOne idea to get towards that goal would be to have a community answer on each question, with say a small reputation bump (2 points?) for participating in making it. To prevent reputation inflation, you can only get the 2 points from a given question one time, with a daily limit (say 10 points) for doing it on questions asked by others.\n\nThen when the question is seen for posterity, it will be the first answer.\n\nThe issue is what to do with the accepted answer?

Anyway, I used Illustrator to create lots of images (with transparent backgrounds) of different letters, each one filled with circles. More to the point, upon exporting as a .PNG, I noticed a resolution option. Me being the little derp that I am, I figured a larger resolution is always better, so I set this to high (300 ppi).\n\nUpon importing the images into my project however, I realized that the images had become a lot larger than they should be. Upon tweaking the export resolution setting, I noticed that if I set this to low (72 ppi), the images come out as the expected size. I was just wondering how I should expect this to effect my drawings. If I were to keep the high resolution images I exported at 300 ppi, am I always going to be forced to reduce their size afterwards by a certain amount? Otherwise, should I always stick to  72 ppi in order to keep the size of the image the same and to avoid needing to re-size things later?\n\nImage quality is not so important in this case, so there probably isn't much reason for me to use anything higher than 72 ppi anyway. Just for the sake of learning however, I thought this would be a good question to ask.\n # of connections: 1","As a bit of background - Windows has a facility for Touch/TabletPCs whereby it shifts the position of popups/menus depending on your \"handedness\" (to prevent the menu appearing under your hand). \n\nEssentially what this does is if you are set to \"right handed\" (which it seems to default to once you've connected a touch device), every popup you open is artificially kicked to the left - this causes massive layout issues where we try and line up a popup with the item it \"popped up from\" :\n\nTablet PC Settings set to Left handed - no artificial correction from Windows\n\n\nTablet PC Settings set to Right handed - Windows artificially adjusts our positioning\n\n\nWe can detect what this setting is set to with SystemParameters.MenuDropAlignment, and for trivial popups we can adjust this using the actual width of the popup - but for dynamic popups and when we throw right to left support into the mix, this just doesn't work.\n\nCurrently it's looking more likely that we are going to have to go through every popup, manually work out a value to adjust the kick, and add something like this to every one:\n\n&lt;MultiDataTrigger&gt;\n    &lt;MultiDataTrigger.Conditions&gt;\n        &lt;Condition Binding=\"{Binding Source={x:Static SystemParameters.MenuDropAlignment}}\" Value=\"True\"/&gt;\n        &lt;Condition Binding=\"{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=Self}, Path=FlowDirection}\" Value=\"RightToLeft\"/&gt;\n    &lt;/MultiDataTrigger.Conditions&gt;\n    &lt;MultiDataTrigger.Setters&gt;\n        &lt;Setter Property=\"HorizontalOffset\" Value=\"-50\"/&gt; &lt;!-- Set to arbitrary value to test --&gt;\n    &lt;/MultiDataTrigger.Setters&gt;\n&lt;/MultiDataTrigger&gt;\n\n\nSo.. back to the question :-) Does anyone know of a way to stop a WPF popup looking at this setting at all? \n\nFor those that don't have a touch device you can access the Tablet PC settings by running:\n\nC:\\Windows\\explorer.exe shell:::{80F3F1D5-FECA-45F3-BC32-752C152E456E}\n\nAnd see the mess it makes for yourself :-)\n # of connections: 1","How to add a website to Safari Top Sites manually instead of viewing it so many times that Safari chose it for you?\n # of connections: 1","In a paper, I ran into the following definition of the zero point fluctuation of our favorite toy, the harmonic oscillator:\n$$x_{ZPF} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{2m\\Omega}} $$\nwhere m is its mass and $\\Omega$ its natural frequency.\nHowever, when I try to derive it with simple arguments, I think of the equality:\n$$E = \\frac12 \\hbar\\Omega=\\frac12 m \\Omega^2 x_{ZPF}^²$$\n(using the energy eigenvalue of the $n=0$ state)\ngiving me:\n\n$$x_{ZPF} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{m\\Omega}} $$\ndiffering from the previous one by a factor $\\sqrt2$.

Once in this state, if nothing is deposited it goes to the 0 state; if a nickel is deposited it goes to the 5 cent state; if a dime is deposited, it does to the 10 cent state. \n\nThe truth table that I came up with is:\n\nPresent|Inputs| Next  |        | SR Flip Flop\n       |      |       | Output |\nQ1  Q0 |D   N |P1   P0|        | S1 R1 S0 R0\n_______|______|_______|________|_____________\n0   0  | 0  0 | 0   0 |   0    | 0  X 0 X\n0   0  | 0  1 | 0   1 |   0    | 0  X 1 0\n0   0  | 1  0 | 1   0 |   0    | 1  0 0 X\n0   0  | 1  1 | X   X |   X    | X  X X X\n_______|______|_______|________|_____________\n0   1  | 0  0 | 0   1 |   0    | 0  X X 0\n0   1  | 0  1 | 1   0 |   0    | 1  0 0 1\n0   1  | 1  0 | 1   1 |   0    | 1  0 X 0\n0   1  | 1  1 | X   X |   X    | X  X X X\n_______|______|_______|________|_____________\n1   0  | 0  0 | 1   0 |   0    | X  0 0 X\n1   0  | 0  1 | 1   1 |   0    | X  0 1 0\n1   0  | 1  0 | 1   1 |   0    | X  0 1 0\n1   0  | 1  1 | X   X |   X    | X  X X X\n_______|______|_______|________|_____________\n1   1  | 0  0 | 0   0 |   1    | 0  1 0 1\n1   1  | 0  1 | 0   1 |   1    | 0  1 X 0\n1   1  | 1  0 | 1   0 |   1    | X  0 0 1\n1   1  | 1  1 | X   X |   X    | X  X X X\n\n\nBased on this truth table [and the k-maps I made from it], I created the following logic gates:\n\n\nMy question is, where exactly does the \"reset\" happen? For example, if I am in the 15 cent state and deposit a nickel, how does it go to the 5 cent stage? Do I have to make the output from \"open\" loop around? Sorry for such a novice question, I hope that made sense!\n\nEdit: The first two columns are for the present state of the machine, i.e., how much you have deposited so far. So Q0 Q1 = 00 represents the first state (0 cents), Q0 Q1 = 01 represents the second state (5 cents), etc. The next two columns represent adding a nickel or dime. If you are in the state 00 and and 01, you should move to state 01. Since you cannot deposit a nickel and dime simultaneously, we don't care about the the input 11. If you are in state 10 and add 10, you go to state 11 (and don't get any change back!).\n # of connections: 1","I lost a few orders at Magento and I am recreating it manually, but I need to keep the old id. \nI do not have enough information to create all the lost orders, because this some orders id need to be skipped, because this I want to manually put the id of them. \n\nI tried the mysql with the command:\n\nupdate sales_flat_order set increment_id=100000180, entity_id=180 where entity_id=168;\n\n\nThanks in advance\n # of connections: 1","\n  “A variable so related to another that for each value assumed by one there is a value determined for the other.” (thefreedictionary.com)\n\n\nI can’t find any possible way how to start with this words.

However, as I study intermolecular forces I feel like this basic Idea is being challenged. My understanding from basic chemistry is that ionic bonds are much stronger than covalent bonds, due to the actual exchange of electrons and the formation of cations and anions, causing an attractive force between the opposite charges to \"hold\" the compound together. When explaining solubility with IMF theory, however, I fail to understand how the IM forces present in water--dipole-dipole, H-bonds, and dispersion--are able to overcome that attraction between the cation and anion present in the ionic bond; because, I was under the impression that actual bonds are always stronger than IMF bonds. So, for instance, does it not infer that if, say, Sodium Chloride is placed into water, and the attraction of the h-bonds in water cause the NaCl to essentially break apart into ions, that the inherent attractions between cations and anions in an ionic compound are weaker than the attraction force of the h-bond water molecule?\n # of connections: 1","How do I use the command key in MacVim?

An object in this category is a tuple $\\mathbf Q = (Q, P; G, H; q, a, \\tilde a)$, where:\n\n\n$G$ is a Lie group, and $H$ is a closed subgroup;\n$P$ is a $G$-torsor and the manifold $Q$ is diffeomorphic to the quotient $G/H$;\nThe (left) actions $\\tilde a : G \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(P)$ and $a : G \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(Q)$ are morphisms of topological groups; and\n$q :P \\to Q$ is a principal $H$-bundle.\n\n\nA morphism $\\Phi : \\mathbf Q \\to \\mathbf Q'$ is described by a tuple $\\Phi = (\\varphi, \\tilde \\varphi, f)$, where $\\varphi : Q \\to Q'$ and $\\tilde \\varphi : P \\to P'$ are diffeomorphisms which commute with the bundle maps $q : P \\to Q$ and $q' : P' \\to Q'$, and $f : G \\to G'$ is a morphism of Lie groups mapping $H$ to $H'$, and which satisfies the identity $$\\tilde a'_{f(g)} \\circ \\tilde \\varphi = \\tilde \\varphi \\circ \\tilde a_g$$ for all $g \\in G$. \n\n\n\nI think that this is the correct categorical description of principal homogeneous bundles; please correct me if I'm wrong. I selected the name $\\operatorname{Klein}$ in homage to Felix Klein and his Erlangen Program.\n\nIt seems that such a bundle $\\mathbf Q$ contains all the data on its symmetries. Namely, I think that its automorphism group $\\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathbf Q)$ is isomorphic to its Lie group Lie group $G = G(\\mathbf Q)$?\n\nIt is easy to see that there is a natural map $K : G \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathbf Q)$, in that each $u \\in G$ corresponds to a unique automorphism $K_u \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathbf Q)$. The morphism $K_u = (k_u, \\tilde k_u, c_u)$ is defined by $$k_u(q) = a_u(q), \\quad \\tilde k_u(p) = \\tilde a_u(p), \\quad \\mathrm{and} \\quad c_u(g) = ugu^{-1}.$$ That is, the morphism $K_u$ acts by left-multiplication on both $Q$ and $P$, but by left-conjugation on $G$.\n\n\nIs this map $K$ surjective? i.e., is $\\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathbf Q)$ isomorphic to $G = G(\\mathbf Q)$?\n\n\nIf the answer is yes, then I think that this captures the notion of \"internal symmetries\" of the bundle, since these are the transformations which preserve the bundle structure. \n\nHowever, I know that groupoids also show up to describe symmetries in a categorical setting, and I would be interested to hear more on that point of view.\n\n\nHow can groupoids be used to describe symmetries in this category?\n\n # of connections: 1","I came across this thought provoking article on Stuck in Customs today that makes a strong case to hold off too much investment in DSLR gear, and instead switch to mirror-less cameras like the Sony NEX. The author prefers to call such cameras 3rd generation cameras to prevent any bias.\n\nThe crux of the argument lies in the smaller size and faster shooting speeds of the new cameras, while the sensor size is an area where they seem to be lacking (Sony &amp; Samsung cameras are APS-C sized though). Currently the big makers - Nikon &amp; Canon - have practically no presence in this market (Nikon seems to be doing something with the V1). However, they seem to have slowed down the introduction of new entry level DSLR models over the last year as well.\n\nSo, as DSLR users looking to build and enhance their kit (there are many like me who've jumped the bandwagon over the last couple of years, and are just starting to build their kit), what are the advantages of sticking with the DSLR system rather than switching to the 3rd gen cameras?\n\nIMO, one point that could cause a massive switch in the DSLR base would be if Nikon &amp; Canon announced mirror-less models compatible with their current lens lineups, but that is a hypothetical scenario.\n\nP.S. There is a similar question on mirror-less cameras, but that seems to be from the perspective of a person starting out rather than a person already invested in the DSLR system.\n # of connections: 1","I'm working on an extension that indexes the content of the entry when publish form is submitted, but I need to know if the entry is a new one or an updated one, and in both case, I need the entry_id (the new one juste created or the old one).\n\nDo you know a way to do that? Should I use an other hook?\n\n--Solution--\n\nIn fact, entry_submission_end come with 3 parameters: entry_id, meta and data. If the entry is a new one, entry_id contains the new entry_id but $data['entry_id'] is 0, so you can have a condition on that to check if you are editing or creating an entry.\n # of connections: 1","The 2009 Star Trek movie and its pending sequels are based on the concept of parallel realities introduced in the season 7 Next Generation episode \"Parallels,\" laying out that anything that could happen has happened in a parallel universe. The Enterprise and its crew from the most recent movie are part of a parallel reality that was created when Nero and Spock came back through the black hole created by red matter in an attempt to stem the destruction caused by a supernova. For clarification, this crew will be referred to as Chris Pine's and the older movies as Shatner's.\n\nIn the movie Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, a probe shows up in 2286 at Earth looking for whales that had disappeared decades before. Shatner's crew is faced with travelling back in time to try and retrieve two humpback whales in order to stop the cylindrical probe from destroying Earth. They do this using a Klingon Bird-of-Prey that was stolen in the previous movie, going back to 1986 to find the whales.\n\nI think it's safe to assume that in Pine's reality, the probe will probably make an appearance again, since the destruction of whales probably wouldn't change. So Pine's crew will also be faced with the dilemma of travelling back to find humpbacks (although probably without using a Klingon ship).\n\nIf Pine's crew also goes back to the same instant in 1986 as Shatner's crew to find whales (which seems highly improbable given that hitting the same time period as Shatner would be ridiculous), would they run into Shatner's crew or would it create another parallel reality stemming from 1986? If it created another reality, that seems like some kind of backwards causality since the event that would be causing the new stem wouldn't be the instant before the ships arrived but an event in the future. Would time travel trump the parallel universe and both Kirks would be there at the same time?\n # of connections: 1","In my viewForAnnotation method I am adding a detail disclosure button to the right of the pin, however it changes the showsUserLocation to be a red pin, with a disclosure button to the right of the \"Current Location\" text.\n\nHow can I stop the current location symbol from being a pin?

The first I got at age 18, and the 2nd I applied for while in grad school for better rewards.  I use credit cards (primarily the more recent one) for routine monthly expenses and I pay them off in full every month and reap the rewards.  The limits were pretty low while I was in school, but every 6 months or so they would notify me that they were raising my credit limit by a modest amount.  This continued for a while, but it stopped not long after I left school (which roughly coincided with banks becoming more reluctant to offer credit).\n\nMy income has increased several hundred percent over what it was while I was in grad school, and I feel my credit limits do not reflect that.  My combined credit limit between the two cards is a little over 12% of my yearly gross income.  I feel this is probably low, and I might like to increase it both to increase my credit score and to easier allow for multiple large purchases (computer, furniture, etc.) in the same month without using an excessively high portion of my available credit.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Here goes then:\n\nLet M be a n-D manifold and $\\dot x=F(x)u_1, F\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}, x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}, u_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}$ be a control system evolving on M (F is the system matrix i.e. state transition function, and $u_1$ is the input of the system. For all practical purposes $u_1$ is an m-vector from an input space $\\mathbb{R}^{m}$). Now let $x=\\Psi (y)$ be a coordinate change on M and $u_2=M(y)u_1$ a transformation of the input $u_1$ of the first system. By applying these maps on the system, you get the new equations  $\\dot y=F(y)u_2$. As you may notice, F is the same in both systems. The problem is why is this happening i.e. for what systems and transformations does this property hold?\n\nA little more elaboration\n\nIt is useful to investigate the maps more closely. In the general case one has\n\n$\\dot x=D\\Psi \\dot y$\n$\\dot x= F(x)u_1$\n\nthus\n$\\dot y=D\\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1$, (1)\n\nwhere $D\\Psi$ is the Jacobian matrix of $\\Psi$. In our case it actually turns out that:  \n\n$\\dot y=F(y)M(y)u_1$. (2)\n\nYou can then consider that $u_2=M(y)u_1$ and get the final system,\n\n$\\dot y=F(y)u_2$,\n\nthat is, the same system.\n By (1),(2) you get,\n\n$D\\Psi ^{-1} F(x)u_1=F(y)M(y)u_1 \\Rightarrow (D\\Psi ^{-1} F(x)-F(y)M(y))u_1=0$. \n\nSince this holds for every $u_1$, you have the condition,\n\n$F(\\Psi (y))=D\\Psi F(y)M(y)$\n\nSo, what does this condition imply? What systems F and maps $\\Psi$ hold this property (of system invariance)? I should note that F is nonlinear and a case study where this actually happens is the kinematic model of a unicycle robot i.e. this.

It's a cheap amp with cheap components.\n\nAnyway, I received it and I noticed the left channel had a slight crackle when I turned the vol pot. It started right when I brought it out of 0 percent. But then it started crackling at around 20, then 50. I assumed it was rust or just the protective film flaking off of the cheap pot. So I sprayed it with some contact cleaner. After much caring for it, I've been able to reduce the crackling back to the original crackling I heard when I first turned the pot. If the amp has been off several hours, then it will slightly crackle when turning the pot up from 0. If I turn the pot a couple of times before turning on the device, then there's no audible issue.\n\nAll the time, this is only happening on the left channel. The right one is 100 percent clean. Other than this, the amp works as expected.\n\nHowever, the other day the amp was off and I turned the pot and heard a slight crackle. I did notice, when I first received the amp through the mail, that if turned off and disconnected, the circuit still retains some power: first thing I did; right out of the box, I switched it on without connecting it and that intensely unnerving blue light the Lepai has around the vol control came on and fade off for a couple of seconds.\n\nSo I'm still trying to make sense of this issue. Trying to know if it's a faulty, old pot that's seeing its last days on the left channel and, therefore, I should just invest in a better pot and change it (because the rest of the amp modestly rocks) or if it's more complicated than that... perhaps an issue with the left channel relay, etc., and I'd better change the device entirely.\n\nI probably am shooting way off the mark here but the first thing I thought when I heard that crackle when the amp was off was that perhaps the speaker-protection relay for the left channel is not working. But does a relay like this only work during on and off? Or does it still work throughout the process? And, if so, does it have the ability to \"filter\" these noises?\n\nI'm thinking that even if some \"filter\" component (not necessarily the relay; if any of you knows the Lepai maybe you know if it has any filter incorporated) is not working like it should, that horrible noise must be coming from the vol pot. Am I wrong to think that? And to think that if the right channel is completely clean, then it must be an issue with the side of the pot that outputs to the left channel?\n\nAnd finally, could this noise be digital and coming from deeper in the circuitry or does it necessarily have to be analog and coming from the pot?\n\nI know this is a layered question but I've been looking for individual answers all over the net and can't find any, so I'm hoping somebody out there can help me out by guiding me into electronics though this, my first mod project.\n\nThanks a lot in advance!\n # of connections: 1","I'm trying to implement an order confirmation module for guest accounts.

The server will have a copy of the unique id and the public key for each device.  \n\n2) The server has a public certificate.\n\n3) When the device wants to send a message: If it wants confidentiality it can encrypt the message using symmetric encryption and the key,salt etc will be encrypted with the servers public key. Then it can use it's private key to digitally sign the message which gives the message Authentication and Integrity. \n\n4) The same process could be reversed when the server wants to send a message to the client. \n\n5) Timestamps will be part of the message to resist replay attacks.

I'm asking this out of curiosity. There are oftentimes questions about whether students should choose a new/old advisor, but I haven't seen any that asked about this from the prof's perspective.\n\nI would assume there are since the challenges and priorities for the two groups are normally somewhat different, but I'm not sure exactly how it would differ. For instance, it might be more difficult for the new PI to recruit students (especially good ones) when they have to \"compete\" with older, better funded peers. This would lead one to think that new PIs might be more likely to take on students they might not necessarily love, but just need bodies in the lab. However, on the other hand, new PIs are more likely to have limited funding, and if they are on the tenure-track, would need their few students to succeed in order to establish a name for themselves in the industry. In this case, it would be detrimental if they chose the wrong student(s) in the beginning, especially if they are limited to the number of students they can afford due to funding issues. I realize that this is field and situation specific, but I'm looking to hear stories/insights from people who have gone through/know about the process.\n\nThanks!\n # of connections: 1","Texture hunting is the photography of walls, surfaces, artefacts, etc, typically outdoors, with the intention of using the photos in a computer game.  The photo could be of a brick or concrete wall, a chain link face, a door / window, or whatever.  It is also possible to photograph a white wall that has been damaged or stained in some way, process it in various ways, and use this as a mask on top of other textures, in order to get a new damaged variant.\n\nTextures are typically lighting-neutral and extremely sharp.  The computer game will compute its own lighting and shadows.  One must avoid having a shadow across the subject, as this will only have to be removed in post-processing.  Typically, texture hunting is done on cloudy days where there is a uniform soft light from the sky.\n\n1024×1024 is a reasonable size of the final texture, but it's usually photographed at a higher res, photoshopped considerably, and then sized down.  The subject of the photo could be something like 5 metres × 5 metres.  The idea is that every pixel is being used to the fullest effect to convey the character of the surface.  Textures are often photoshopped to become seamless so they can be repeated across a large surface in game.\n\nTextures are usually shot perpendicular to the wall as much as possible, otherwise distortion correction is required.  Sometimes you can take a photo from further away and zoom in to get a better view of a high wall.\n\nIt is often quite hard to find a surface in the real world that has an interesting texture and is easy to photograph from the right angle.  In particular, taking photos of the floor is challenging because you need to be several metres above it, looking down.  Leaning out of windows / over bridges, or holding up a tripod are solutions.\n\nOne thing that concerns me is that some cameras do image processing on the digital image.  Really, the artist has to be doing all of the image processing offline, in photoshop or similar.  I often see digital camera photos with edge enhancement artefacts in high contrast areas.  Perhaps raw shooting mode is the answer to this?\n\nShooting digital photos with greater colour depth than \"8 bit per channel\" might also be useful to avoid banding when increasing contrast during post-processing.\n\nAnother thing is lens distortion — since we need to photograph flat surfaces.  Either the camera has to be good at it, or it should be possible to turn it off so the processing can be done manually by an artist.\n\nHow do I find a camera which meets these requirements?\n # of connections: 1","I'm fairly new to the world of python and GIS - so this is definitely a beginner question.\n\nI am following Tom Macwrights small guide to Shapely and Fiona, and I noticed that even when opening the previously created shapefile, it doesn't contain the schema I defined using:\n\nschema = { \n      'geometry': 'Point', \n      'properties': { 'name': 'str' } }\n\n\nThis is evident because when I try to call it using schema = input.schema.copy(), it spits out AttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'schema'\n\nReading the Fiona documentation, it states that:\n\n\n  the schema of its record type (a vector file has a single type of record, remember) is accessed via a read-only schema attribute. \n\n\nDoes that mean that it is not possible to store a schema in the shapefile,a nd therefore I'm always required set up the variables in the beginning, rather than reading from the file using input.schema.copy()?

I finally got Windows 7 set up how I like it and decided on a suite of software that I will be installing after each format. Since I tested a bunch of programs and the Windows installation is full of Junk, a clean install is needed. After I reinstall Win7 along with all the other software, I want to make a Drive Image so I can at any time go back to that exact setup. In the past I used Clonezilla. I would have it backup the entire drive, compress it, and then transfer it to a network store. This process is a pain in the butt though. It also ends up taking up too much space since Clonezilla uses dd and dd does not care what filesystem you are using. It makes a copy of the drive sector by sector. It doesn't know where a file ends or free space begins. This is what I am looking for this time around... (I don't care if its Open Source or Commercial, although free alternatives are always nice).\n\n\nDoes not include Unused Space in the drive image\nBacks up the MBR and any other absolutely necessary information so the system goes back to exactly the way it was when it was backed up. I don't want to be worried that I have to repair the MBR or deal with other booting issues.\nCan write the image to multiple DVDs AND to a network share. This means that it has to be able to split the backup.\nDoes not need Windows to work. It has a bootable disc version of the program in case I can't get into Windows and need to restore the backup.\nPreferably makes the initial backup DVD (Disc 1) also the boot disc. So I can insert disc 1 into the computer, restart, and it will allow me to begin restoring the image to the drive. It would only ask for Disc 2 after it restored everything from the disc it booted from.\nLoads itself into RAM, does not need to have the disc in the drive to function.\nSupports NTFS (This should be pretty obvious).\nAllows me to view the image file in a file editor and make changes in case I want to add/remove anything. (I don't care if this is only possible on the single file Network Backup and I have to recreate the DVDs. The bootable version does not need this).\nI am going to be using this software only to image the drive. It will not be my daily/weekly/monthly backup solution. Therefore I don't want the imaging to force me into some backup schedule. If I have to force it to not make automatic backups after the initial image, I don't want it.\nIs reliable, you would use it, makes consistently good images.\n\n\nI guess that's it. Hopefully someone here knows of a program that does all this.

I am baffled by a nagging question regarding Modern Hebrew and Biblical Hebrew. Eliezer Ben-Yehudah is known to have revitalized Hebrew, in part by taking Biblical and post-Biblical (often Mishnaic and/or Rabbinic) Hebrew words, and sometimes Aramaic words, and adapting them to modern uses. But there are words that are not new to the world, and certainly could not have been new to our ancestors, which he apparently adapted from the classical sources because he could not find evidence of them there but found similar words that could be made to apply. The example I'm trying to understand is the Hebrew word for \"ice\".\n\nIn the Mishnah Berurah above why did the M\"B need to describe ice as \"water which has frozen\"? Furthermore, why did he have to Hebraicize the Aramaic word for \"freeze\"? Is there no classical Hebrew word for \"ice\" or even \"freeze\"? According to http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0131.htm \"קֶרַח\" translates as \"frost\". According to http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/גלד the word \"גלד\" is Aramaic for \"freeze\" and Hebrew (presumably modern) for \"scab\". I have also seen elsewhere in my search today that \"גלד\" is also used in the context of congealing (I believe in Hebrew).\n\nIs there no other classical Hebrew source for a word that translates directly as \"ice\"?

I have always (since I was 14) wanted to do my own research one day. As I grew older, I knew that mathematics was what I wanted to do. So I went to the university to study mathematics. After having encountered a course in group theory I knew that I belonged to the algebraic part of mathematics. I did my bachelor project in group theory and when I became a graduate student (September 2013), I took courses and made a project supporting my interest in algebra.\n\nAlong the way I created the vision that I would finish my master degree as a dedicated student in algebra. In order to realize this vision my plan was to study abroad for one semester taking new algebraic courses.\n\nThe situation\n\nMy situation today is that my study abroad semester begins tomorrow. As mentioned my dream is to do my own research, but more generally/important: I want to develop new ideas and be dedicated to something and I would love to follow/explore my passion.\n\nMy first thought (as many other students): I should get a PhD. So I did some research and figured out that there was an available position at the university I'm currently studying at in geometric group theory.\n\nI don't know much about geometric group theory, but I do know that I love group theory. So I would really like to know if this is an opportunity or if I should just forget it.\n\nI don't want to pursue a PhD for anything in this world. I just want to stay focus on creating a meaningful work life around my passion.\n\nAny advice?\n\n\n\nFurther remarks\n\nI'm a student from Denmark and I'm studying abroad in Austria for one semester. After my study abroad semester I still have to study one year for my master degree in Denmark. However this year consists of a half year with elective courses and a half year where I'm making my master's thesis. \n\nI don’t know much about the PhD position. I found it from a Google search (: “PhD position group theory”). There is only given a starting date and an e-mail address for contact. I’m going to attend a course held by the supervisor of the project, so the whole thing is a coincidence. \n\nI have investigated my opportunities for a position at my home university. One of my supervisors, a professor in group theory, told me that he couldn't offer me a position, since it was a question about money, but would like to recommend me. I don't think the university accepts PhD students without a master degree and the positions are without project descriptions.\n\nHowever there is also another university (in Denmark) with a talent program where it is possible to get a PhD position without having a master degree. I contacted them and they told me I should apply after my study abroad semester (because I would have a stronger profile).

Its half-life ($t_{1/2}$) is only 5,730 years—that is, every 5,730 years, half of it decays away. The theoretical limit for C-14 dating is 100,000 years using AMS, but for practical purposes it is 45,000 to 55,000 years. If dinosaur bones are 65 million years old, there should not be one atom of C-14 left in them.\n\nDinosaurs are not dated with Carbon-14, yet some researchers have claimed that there is still Carbon-14 in the bones.\n\nSo what needs to be done about this inconsistency? Do these data indicate that a more accurate method needs to be derived? What solutions are available for increasing accuracy of the tests? Or do we need another dating method all together?\n\nConsidering Contamination\n\nFrom the source linked above:\n\n\n  Carbon-14 is considered to be a highly reliable dating technique.  It's accuracy has been verified by using C-14 to date artifacts whose age is known historically. The fluctuation of the amount of C-14 in the atmosphere over time adds a small uncertainty, but contamination by \"modern carbon\" such as decayed organic matter from soils poses a greater possibility for error.\n  \n  Dr. Thomas Seiler, a physicist from Germany, gave the presentation in Singapore.  He said that his team and the laboratories they employed took special care to avoid contamination. That included protecting the samples, avoiding cracked areas in the bones, and meticulous pre-cleaning of the samples with chemicals to remove possible contaminants.  Knowing that small concentrations of collagen can attract contamination, they compared precision Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) tests of collagen and bioapatite (hard carbonate bone mineral) with conventional counting methods of large bone fragments from the same dinosaurs. \"Comparing such different molecules as minerals and organics from the same bone region, we obtained concordant C-14 results which were well below the upper limits of C-14 dating. These, together with many other remarkable concordances between samples from different fossils, geographic regions and stratigraphic positions make random contamination as origin of the C-14 unlikely\".\n\n # of connections: 1","What features make one plant able to withstand dry spells better than another with relatively similar structure?

Someone could plausibly test your site against leaked data from big-name hacks, and if the users are reusing their passwords across sites, then your site is potentially vulnerable.\n\nThe solution to this could be simply giving more generic feedback about what went wrong without specifically mentioning email, although that could be frustrating for the average user trying to sign up.

That the screw will strip out the knob, or it will ream out the hole in the door. Well, it seems sloppy.\n\nWhen I notice one, I give it a twist to tighten.

I don't get dealer services, but go to a mechanic who has always been good and uses the same oils and genuine parts that BMW use. He used to be a BMW tech for about 25 years before going out on his own and is considerably cheaper.\n\nBefore we proceed, I apologise for the long story and hope you can bear with me. Make yourself a tea or coffee before you read this. I greatly appreciate any help anyone has to offer.\n\nThe story begins about 2 weeks ago when I took my car to the mechanic for a service. I was experiencing issues where the car was sluggy and I had an oil leak, simple enough I thought.\n\nThe mechanic called me and said they discovered a couple of inches of the fuel line beneath the car had been crushed (the hose is metal bent at weird angles and whatnot) and brake lines had also been squashed basically flat. The lines were squashed by a loose chunk of concrete coming off of a driveway. They called BMW and they were quoted $1300 AUD and a 3 week wait as the lines had to come from Germany.\n\nThey phoned around and were able to find second hand lines for about $400. They fitted the new lines and discovered the source of the leak was actually the oil filter, at first they thought the mount was cracked, but the car just needed a new oil filter. They also discovered a faulty part (a thermostat they had only replaced not even a year ago) still under warranty that they replaced. An engine mount near the alternator was also replaced, I recall they mentioned having to remove the alternator and whatnot to get to it.\n\nAfter spending $2200 AUD on the repairs (a little more than I was expecting), I picked the car up and for a day it was perfect. It had a new-found sense of performance, was smoother than ever. Then the second day rolled around and my fiance calls me to tell me the car was blowing white smoke.\n\nShe picked me up and the car would pour out copious amounts of white smoke when taking off from lights, going up hills, etc. It wasn't a small amount either, it was literally clouds. It didn't have a sweet smell, more of a fume smell. The car was also idling rough and driving pretty rough as well, wasn't overly lacking power though.\n\nI know what you are thinking and yes, it was my first thought too: the head gasket is blown and coolant and oil were mixing together. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach.\n\nAfter the car had cooled down, I checked the oil and coolant. The oil was pretty much empty, it was below the minimum mark and the coolant was also a quarter down. Looking at the mechanic invoice it said they used about 6 litres of synthetic oil, where did it go I wondered. I checked the coolant and it was clean, I checked the oil and it was clean. I've seen what a blown head gasket looks like this wasn't looking the case. The oil had vanished, and some of the coolant as well, but it didn't appear as though the two were mixing.\n\nEvery time the car was started from a stationery position, it would blow lots of white smoke as it did when the car was being driven. Moisture getting into the engine somewhere seemed to be the most likely cause.\n\nBecause it was a late Friday evening and the mechanic workshop wasn't open until Monday, I decided to carefully fill the oil and coolant back up, I had some demineralised water and I also had some synthetic motor oil on hand. I filled the oil to just a little below the minimum mark and the coolant back to the full mark. I would call the mechanic on Monday and do some observational testing over the weekend.\n\nAs soon as I topped up both fluids, I started the car and no white smoke. I let it run for about 15 minutes. I turned it off, checked fluids and they were still full. The oil still appeared to be clean. I drove the car around the block and the white smoke was still gone. This was a good sign, but also a sign perhaps they forgot to top up the oil they charged me for, had it done damage I wondered?\n\nThe next morning I started the car and a puff of white smoke emerged and then cleared. Driving it however seemed to pose no problem, the white smoke would only appear after the car had been turned off and sitting for quite a while and first started. I checked the fluids and the oil was fine, the coolant had gone down a really tiny bit. Because I always park my car on a drip tray I noticed there was a water like oil substance on the tray, it wasn't a large amount, but enough to make me take notice. The oil had not gone down which made it all the more weird, where was the oil like colour and substance coming from?\n\nSunday rolled around the subsequently the same thing. No oil loss, coolant had gone down a bit more, white smoke on initial start after sitting and then cleared. I was hopeful when I took it to the mechanic on Monday it would be resolved.\n\nI took it to the mechanic finally, I told them how the oil was empty and I topped it up, I also explained the coolant loss and they got me to start the car. Because the cloud of white smoke only happens on start, they couldn't see it. They said they could see a tiny bit of exhaust smoke and then subsequently tried telling me because of the age of the car (it's a 2005) that it was most likely the valve stem seals.\n\nThey then sold me a bottle of what looked like water which they poured into the oil for softening up the valve stem seals and said to keep an eye on it. They said if I notice any troubles, to bring it back. I stupidly went along with it even after explaining the oil loss and coolant loss. They offered no possible explanation as to why the oil was empty, I assumed it wasn't topped up. \n\nAll of these issues are new ones I didn't have before I took the car to them, why would the valve stem seals all of a sudden cause me an issue after coincidentally getting it looked over and work done?\n\nA couple of days had passed and the white smoke issue had temporarily disappeared and I thought, oh, maybe they were right. Then I noticed the smoke had returned again on start, I checked the fluids again and the oil was clean and fine. There were no signs of oil in the coolant or coolant in the oil. I however had noticed the coolant had dropped to about the half way mark now and the watery like oil was still leaking onto the drip tray.\n\nI called them up and they said to bring it back down, I was determined to get them to actually look at the car this time. It was raining and I parked in the car park. The mechanic dude came out and I explained the situation. He offered no possible explanation for the coolant loss. It was also coincidentally raining and has been for the past few days. He said the water from the rain would have washed whatever was leaking from underneath and to bring it back when it's not raining.\n\nWhat is going on here? What are my rights? I feel so helpless and trapped at the moment. I feel as though they're trying to avoid looking at the car properly maybe because they know they're responsible and scared maybe they blew the head gasket which is an expensive job.\n\nWhat should I say to them next time I see them to make sure it gets fixed and looked at without incurring cost upon myself? I know it's hard, but what are some potential issues that could be responsible for my symptoms? Coolant loss, not going into the oil and oil not going down.\n # of connections: 1","I'm looking for a good business plan LaTeX template for a web startup.

We can easily decompose a complex cycle to a set of simple cycles by breaking up the cycle at those points where the cycle passes through the same vertex more than once.\n\nAs the first part of our proof, we will prove that if $G$ has an Euler tour, in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$) for each vertex $v \\in V$.\n\nWe have already established that a complex cycle can be decomposed to a collection of simple cycles. However vertices on a simple cycle have in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$)=1.\n\nSince each vertex in a complex cycle, and therefore in an Euler tour, is part of one or more simple cycles it will have in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$).\n\n\nCould you give me an example of a complex cycle that is decomposed to a set of simple cycles, where we can see that in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$)?\n\n\nThe second part of our proof requires us to prove that if in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$) for each vertex $v \\in V$, $G$ has an Euler-tour.\n\nLet $C$ be the complex cycle involving the most edges in $G$.\n\nIn order for $G$ not to be an Euler tour, there must be some vertices that $C$ passes through ( since the graph is connected ) but does not exhaust all edges. We have already established that the vertices of a complex cycle have the property that in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$). Therefore $G'=G-C$ will also have that property. If a connected component in a graph has in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$) then it contains at least one cycle $C'$. However this contradicts our initial hypothesis that $C$ is the cycle involving the most edges in $G$ since we would construct a larger cycle by starting at some common vertex of $C$ and $C'$, traversing all of $C$s edges and then $C'$s edges. Therefore $C$ is an Euler tour.\n\n\nFirst of all, it says that \"In order for $G$ not to be an Euler tour, there must be some vertices that $C$ passes through ( since the graph is connected ) but does not exhaust all edges. \" \n\n\nI haven't understood why we have to show that $G$ does not exhaust all edges.

Therefore $G'=G-C$ will also have that property.\"\n\nWhy will $G'=G-C$ be a complex cycle, although $G$ isn't necessarily?\n\nAlso, could you explain me why it holds that: \" If a connected component in a graph has in-degree($v$)=out-degree($v$) then it contains at least one cycle $C'$.\"\n\nFinally, could you explain me the contradiction?\n\nEDIT: I also want to describe an algorithm that runs in time $O(E)$ and finds an Euler tour of $G$, if it exists.

Done. \nThis is how the PK looks like if I script it from SQL Server:\n\nALTER TABLE [dbo].[Friend] ADD  CONSTRAINT [PK_Friend] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED \n(\n  [UserId] ASC,\n  [Id] ASC\n)\n\n\nHowever, on SQL Azure, when I try to execute the above, it will of course fail:\n\nTable 'Friend' already has a primary key defined on it.\n\nFine, so I try to drop the key:\n\nTables without a clustered index are not supported in this version of SQL Server. Please create a clustered index and try again.\n\nOk, so I try to create a temporary clustered index in order to drop the PK:\n\nCREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Test ON [Friend] ([UserId],[Id])\n\n\nWhich results in: \nCannot create more than one clustered index on table 'Friend'. Drop the existing clustered index 'PK_Friend' before creating another.\n\nGreat, a catch22 moment.\n\nHow do I add the UserId column to my existing PK?\n # of connections: 1","General Onimaru's Clockwork Soldier ability prevents players from moving backwards.

The latter is explainable with octet, but not the former. Surprisingly, $\\ce{SnCl2}$ is more stable! \n\n\nHow?\nWhy is the phenomenon happening?\n\n\n\n\nDave pointed out that the octet nonabidingness is happening in the vapor phase. So I redirect the question to ask about the vapor phase; since that's what I'm looking for.\n # of connections: 1","Scenario:\n\n\nAlice prepares an URL link to Bob's web service (e.g., http://www.bob.com/sensitiveData/123?login=mallory).\nAlice gives the URL link to Mallory.\nMallory follows the link to trigger an action in Bob's system.\n\n\nAlice's link is intended for Mallory. Note that Mallory is authenticated by Alice but not by Bob. Bob does not know Mallory, but he trusts Alice. So if Alice has authorized Mallory to perform the action, Bob will blindly execute it.\n\nThe problem: How can Bob be sure that it is really Alice's link and that Mallory has not modified it in step 2?\n\nIn theory, such problems can be solved by a digital signature with a public-key algorithm. Alice could generate a signature of the link with her private key and append it to the URL, for example, http://www.bob.com/sensitiveData/123?login=mallory&amp;signiture=&lt;SOME-SIGNITURE&gt;).\n\nHow do you generate the signature? As an experiment, I just tried gpg --encrypt but the results are quite huge. Additionally, it has to be encoded to use it inside an URL (e.g., with Base64), which will make it even larger.\n\nAs I'm not very experienced with cryptographic algorithms and protocols, I wanted to ask whether there is an well-known solution to the problem of generating signed URLs?\n\nIf not, do you see any flaw in my approach? Do you have any recommendation for the generation of the signature that can be appended to the link? If possible, it should be relatively short.\n\n\n\nJust for clarification: Unfortunately, it is not possible to change the overall protocol. Of course, it would be safer if Alice and Bob could directly communicate over an encrypted connection. Additionally, Mallory should have to ask Alice to tell Bob to trigger the action, or Bob should have the option to ask Alice to authorize the action.\n # of connections: 1","I am trying to generate a WSDL that expose only some of my objects and methods. \n\nThe Enterprise WSDL expose every object and method that my org has. \n\nI know that it could be possible \"cutting\" the generated XML by hand taking care the dependences, but is there any tool to resolve those dependences? or to regenerate a WSDL from other WSDL choosing the exposed methods?\n # of connections: 1","Cam anyone provide me the proof of:\n\n\n  that $\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\setminus (\\mathbb{Q}\\times \\mathbb{Q}) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is connected.\n\n # of connections: 1","I have creates two tables in sql server 2008  \n\nas shown in diagram\n\nI have added some data in product table \n\ninsert into tblproduct values (\"I PHONE\");\ninsert into tblproduct values (\"SAMSUNG\");\ninsert into tblproduct values (\"SONY\");\n...etc\n\n\nNow my Question is how will I write sql statement for inserting data in tblOrder\nso that Pid will be automatically filled in tblOrder.\n # of connections: 1","My program uses graphics convolution, an algorithm that processes pixels to make them round, soft and blurred.

Learning through an example can be worthy, but the more global this maths background is, the better.\n\nTo say it in other words, how does a cryptographer prove the essential properties of his design ?

My problem is that the promise return from an $http call is not resolving the code inside of its '.then'.\n\nI am working to handle error messages that come back from the server, specifically to handle any 401 errors which are returned when the user has input the wrong username or password.  However, when a 401 is returned, the .then never resolves itself and the code within them never runs.\n\nThe relevant code is as follows:\n\nThe controller for the login form as a login function on its scope, as follows:\n\n$scope.login = function() {\n    $scope.authError = null;\n\n    // Try to login\n    var promise = session.login($scope.user);\n\n    promise.then(function(loggedIn) {\n\n        // THIS CODE NEVER RUNS\n\n        if ( !loggedIn ) {\n            $scope.authError = localizedMessages.get('login.error.invalidCredentials');\n        }\n\n    }, function(x) {\n        $scope.authError = localizedMessages.get('login.error.serverError', { exception: x });\n    });\n};\n\n\nI have a session factory that takes care of the login and other session based needs.  The code for login is:\n\nlogin: function(credentials) {\n    var $http = $injector.get('$http');\n    var url = ENV.apiEndpoint + \"/sessions\";\n\n    var newSession = $http.post(url, credentials);\n\n    return newSession.then(function(data) {\n        session.set(data.token);\n\n        //THIS CODE ONLY RUNS ON A SUCCESS RESPONSE\n\n        if(session.isAuthenticated()) {\n            closeLoginModal(true);\n        }\n\n        return session.isAuthenticated();\n    });\n}\n\n\nI have placed comments in the code where the problem is. I am at a loss as to why this code isn't working.  From my understanding of promises, then 'then' should resolve no matter what the response was, success of error.  \n\nI have an interceptor running, but I have tried disabling it with no luck to the end result.\n\nAm I missing something?\n # of connections: 1","I have character models which have different parts, ex: upper body, head, lower body; each part is a separate mesh in the same model.

Now, one of the things I want to be able to do (and have done, quite effectively) is open up parts of the application to \"3rd Party\" applications, using Android's build-in inter-process communication protocol (AIDL). So far so good.\n\nHere's the catch: because we're involved in handling quite a lot of personal information, we have to be quite careful about who can and can't access it; specifically, only \"Trusted\" applications should be able to do so. So the natural way to do this is to use a custom permission within the AndroidManifest.xml file where we declare the services. My problem is this: I want to be able to enact signature-level protection (similar to the normal \"signature\" permission level), but with a bit of a catch:\n\nI don't only want application signed with our internal signature to be able to access the services. I'd like to be able to build a list of \"trusted signatures\" &amp; at runtime (or if there's a better way, then maybe some other time?) be able to check incoming requests against this list of trusted keys.\n\nThis would satisfy the security constraints in the same way as the normal \"signature\" permission level I think - only programs on the \"trusted keys list\" would be able to access the services, and keys are hard to spoof (if possible at all?) - but with the added bonus that we wouldn't have to sign every application making use of the APIs with our internal team's key.\n\nIs this possible at the moment in Android?

After viewing some drawings of the apparatus, I assumed that the lines holding the weights would have to be attached to the drum.  They would then be allowed to fall completely through a certain distance until the lines were at full length and the mechanical motion of the fluid would have to be allowed to continue to flow, causing the weights to be pulled up a bit and drop again, oscillating up and down until the motion stopped and all of the mechanical energy from the weights would be transferred into the fluid.\n\nHowever, upon watching some videos, (this video is about 14 minutes long; but, if you advance to about 5 min 30 sec, it will show the experiment in question.) I noticed that the weights were allowed to be stopped by a level surface (an external force) instead of doing what I have described above.  To me, this means the weights were still in motion and, therefore, still had KE that was not transferred into the fluid.  \n\nOf course, the weights are moving very slowly, much more slowly than if they had been allowed to free-fall through the distance; so, their kinetic energy is very small compared to the potential energy they lost, meaning the vast majority of the potential energy was transferred into the fluid and into other, small energy losses.\n\nShould I assume the speeds of the weights were small enough to ignore the KE in the weights?\n\nThe assumption seems to be that the potential energy lost by the falling weights was all transferred into the fluid.  However, in the experiments, the lines have to be wound back up and the weights dropped several times in order to make a measurable difference in temperature.  Each time the weights fall, they are stopped by an external force, meaning they have kinetic energy that is not transferred into the fluid after falling through a measured distance.  It seems to me that some of the potential energy from the weights is transferred into the fluid; but, some of it is transferred into the kinetic energy of the weights falling.\n # of connections: 1","So, I have an Address to validate and it has 4 input fields and 4 output fields, basically the 4 output fields are city,state,county and municipality.

The rule is shown to become invalid only when the interaction between the clusters is large enough to disturb their internal motion.\n\n\nThe quaintness of the abstract is enhanced by the mysterious failure to mention neutrons -- this being explained by the fact that the neutron was not discovered experimentally until the following year. Pretty amusing that the American Physical Society still owns the copyright on a paper this old, one of whose authors was probably paid through my grandparents' and great-grandparents' income taxes.\n\nGoogling quickly turns up various loose verbal characterizations of this result, without proof. Can anyone supply an outline of how the argument works and possibly a more precise statement of what the result really is?\n\nSome sources seem to refer to this as the Wigner-Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer (WEO) result or Ehrenfest-Oppenheimer-Bethe (EOB) rule. Historically, Feynman seems to have used this result to show that Cooper pairs were bosonic.\n\nAlthough I've tagged this question as quantum field theory, and the spin-statistics theorem is relativistic, the 1931 date seems to indicate that this would have been a result in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. This answer by akhmeteli sketches what seems to be a similar relativistic result from a book by Lipkin.\n\nIn the limit of low-energy experiments, the EO rule says the usual spin-statistics connection applies, and this seems extremely plausible. If not, then it would be too good to be true: we would be able to probe the composite structure of a system to arbitrarily high energies without having to build particle accelerators.\n\nBethe 1997 has the following argument:\n\n\n  Consider now tightly bound composite objects like nuclei. It then makes sense to ask for the symmetry of the wavefunction of a system containing many identical objects of the same type, e.g., many He4 nuclei. This symmetry can be deduced by imagining that the interchange of two composites is carried out particle by particle. Each interchange of fermions changes the sign of the wavefunction. Hence the composite will be a fermion if and only if it contains an odd number of fermions[...]\n\n\nNote the qualifier \"tightly bound,\" which implies a restriction to low-energy experiments. The abstract of Ehrenfest 1931 seems to say that this is a necessary assumption, but it is never used in Bethe and Jackiw's argument, and this suggests that their argument is an oversimplification.\n\nFujita 2009 recaps the Bethe-Jackiw argument, but then says:\n\n\n  We shall see later that these arguments are incomplete. We note that Feynman used these arguments to deduce that Cooper pairs [5] (pairons) are bosonic [6]. The symmetry of the many-particle wavefunction and the quantum statistics for elementary particles are one-to-one [1]. [...] But no one-to-one correspondence exists for composites since composites, by construction, have extra degrees of freedom. Wavefunctions and second-quantized operators are important auxiliary quantum variables, but they are not observables in Dirac's sense [1]. We must examine the observable occupation numbers for the study of the quantum statistics of composites. In the present chapter we shall show that EOB's rule applies to the Center-of-Mass (CM) motion of composites.\n\n\nUnfortunately I only have access to Fujita through a keyhole, so I can't see what the references are or any of the details that they promise in this beginning-of-chapter preview.\n\nRelated: Huge confusion with Fermions and Bosons and how they relate to total spin of atom\n\nBethe and Jackiw, Intermediate Quantum Mechanics\n\nP.

Sorry if it's a bit of a novice question. For the record, I don't fully know GR, but don't let that stop you from using it in the answer.\n\nSince the universe is expanding - that is, the spacetime metric is expanding by way of a near-exponentially increasing scale factor - we can say that the distance between any two non-bound objects is increasing over time. Herein lays my dilemma; if there were two objects separated by a large distance that had no relative velocities initially, after a long time, the effects of expansion would cause them to have large apparent velocities away from each other. Given that there hasn't been any acceleration to cause these velocities, are there still relativistic effects in play? That is, is there time dilation between the two frames?\n\nFurthermore, given long enough time, the rate of increasing distance between the two objects could place them outside of their visible horizon (ie they are travelling away from each other at superluminal velocities). Since there was still no acceleration to achieve this feat, what can one say about the relativistic effects in this case?\n\nAt first I thought this was an easy question. I thought of course there would be relativistic effects and when the objects go superluminal, the visible horizon is there to ensure there can never be causal contact and thus preserve physics. But then I thought what if spacetime stopped expanding abruptly (seems crazy but as far as I know, nothing makes this completely impossible)?

I want the bottom part including\"Our Values\" to be editable from that panel too, is there a way to do this or does this content have to be static and within the template? \"Our Values\" and \"Our People\" are in a dynamic secondary navigation menu which my client can add items to if they want to, however they can't change the content for the menu item.\n\nImages:\nhttp://imgur.com/yq9y8SQ,5IqOPzr,SHkzrFz\n\nPlease help me out guys, I've been looking all over the place for days to get this done.\n # of connections: 1","What are the benefits of adding the variables into a model one by one, as compared to adding them all at the same time?\n\nAs I see in most research, the first model that is tested is consisted of all the control variables, then in the second model the first predictor is added, then the second one, and so on, until all predictors are in the model.\n\nAre there any benefits in using this approach, or would it be ok to have just do two models - one with just the controls, and one with controls + all other predictors. \n\n(p.s.) - am interested in this with regards to logistic regression\n # of connections: 1","I'm attempting to set up a config file for Mule ESB 2.2.1 that routes incoming requests to another box.

The auto detect then grabs this file\n\nWhat I need essentially is a way for the proxy.pac to figure out if a client is on a VPN connection so that it can resolve a DIRECT for them. \n\nSo if I do a simple var myIp = myipAddress() and then just have it match it from a list of these fixed addresses then it would be solved. However the myIpAddress() function seems to be picking up the local Ip to the machine (eg: 192.168.10.1) and not the network adapter. In my case that local address is my MS Loopback which is needed for some of my local VMs. If I disable my Loopback adapter it starts resolving the correct address. This is not an ideal workaround.\n\nSo how do I go about resolving the Ip address I want from the correct adapter?\n\n\nI have been conducting this testing from my local machine for now.\nI am aware that it is not a closed VPN solution, it is just what has been decided at the moment.\n\n\nThanks in advance...\n # of connections: 1","On the near future I will have a WordPress blog, public and visible to anyone, that has a members area.

However, in this question, Kosmonaut has an answer in which he states:\n\"Let's say that tomorrow you will walk your dog from 7 - 8 AM\".\n\nOn the one hand, you probably planned to walk your dog long before and thus I should use \"Let's say that tomorrow you're going to walk your dog from 7 - 8 am\". \n\nOn the other hand, since I'm saying \"let's say...\", I'm deciding right now (thus, unplanned) that you will walk your dog. So, even though in this hypothetical situation you made a plan, I'm in a more spontaneous mood deciding right now that that's what you will do tomorrow, and, thus, I should use \"will\".\n\nWhich one (if any) of the above explanations is right?\n # of connections: 1","What are the most convenient beaches near Athens (Greece) that are 2 hours or less to get to?

Mine is a 2D platformer game with a world made up of (usually) immobile tiles and mobile sprites, both of which use AABBs to represent their hitboxes. This game is NOT grid-based due to some complications with moving layers of tiles.\n\nI can detect collisions and easily figure out the depth of the collision. I use the \"shallowest axis method\" to determine which way to resolve a collision between the sprite and the tile. If the sprite is deeper horizontally than vertically, the direction to resolve is either up or down. If the sprite is deeper vertically than horizontally, the direction to resolve is either left or right.\n\n\n\nThis is simple enough, and it works pretty well. That is, until you have a sprite colliding with more than one tile. As, by their nature, each collision has to be checked separately, different collisions may have different direction to resolve in. For example, if a sprite is trying to walk across a row of tiles, for one frame they will intersect the next tile such that the horizontal depth is shorter than the vertical depth. As the collision says \"resolve left\", it will be pushed back and will be stuck on the corner.\n\n\n\nI've been mulling this problem over, on and off, for quite some time, and several solutions have come to me, but all have flaws. I could mark certain sides as unreachable, but without a grid-based engine, determining \"unreachability\" is remarkably complex, especially with moving layers of tiles always a possibility.\n\nAnother possible method would be to predict collisions before they happen and \"work back\" the movement to the point of the collision, I suppose, but I'm not sure how the math on that works.\n\nI feel that I'm missing something incredibly obvious, especially since games from the 80s have already solved this problem.\n # of connections: 1","I have C++ widget code that was generated by QtDesigner (Qt open source v 4.7.3, using the Form->View Code menu in QtDesigner). \n\nI have modified that code in a manner that is entirely Qt compliant - just hand coded a few more signals, slots and wigdets based on the patterns of the generated code - code runs perfectly when built with Code::Blocks. \n\nNow I'd like to convert my modified C++ source back into the ui XML format that QtDesigner uses.

Right now there a are three different types of content. The first two are just strings uploaded into a textfield by the user. One is twitter handles and hashtags, the other is URLs. The second type is photos. \n\nThe user can upload as many individual instances of these types content as he/she wants to given a feed which will is the then passed to the iOS app via an API call to display. \n\nThe current approach I am using is to have Feed, Picture, Twitter, and Webpage models. When the user crates a new Feed, they then associate the appropriate content with that feed via a one to many relationship between each Feed instance it's content instances. \n\nWhen it comes time to display to content the user has uploaded, a GET request for a given stream is generated and the Feed model then does the following awful thing determine what type of content should be shown: \n\n def Feed.get_content_for_feed(feed_id)\n    return self.map_type_to_class(feed_id).get_content_for_feed(feed_id)\n  end\n\n  private\n\n  def Feed.map_type_to_class(feed_id)\n    feed_type_id = Feed.find(feed_id).feed_type_id\n    not_yet_implemented = nil\n    case stream_type_id\n      when 1\n        return Webpages\n      when 2\n        return Pictures\n      when 3\n        return not_yet_implemented\n      when 4\n        return Twitter\n      when 5\n        return not_yet_implemented\n      when 6\n        return not_yet_implemented\n      when 7\n        return not_yet_implemented\n      when 8\n        return not_yet_implemented\n      else\n        return nil\n\n    end\n  end\n\n\nThen each content class implements a get_content_for_feed method to return the content:\n\ndef Twitter.get_content_for_feed(feed_id)\n    tweet_urls = self.where(:feed_id =&gt; feed_id.to_i)\n    if tweet_urls.empty?\n      return []\n    else\n      return tweet_urls\n    end\n  end\n\n\nSo it just returns the appropriate class.

Then we say that $H(n)$ is a perfect hash function iff:\n\n\n$H:\\mathbb N \\to \\{0,1\\}^\\infty$; That is, $H$ maps each natural number to an infinite binary sequence, and which the time complexity to compute any initial segment $s$ is polynomial in the size of $n$ and $s$, (making it a sponge function).\nFor any initial segment of length $d$, the set of all natural numbers $n$ such that $H(n)$ shares that initial segment has natural density $2^{-d}$.\n\n\nThe first thing formalizes the scalability of our function, and the second thing formalizes the idea that we want all hashes to appear roughly \"equally often\" as an output. Other than that, our perfect hash function is a black box, and we don't care much about exactly how it works, so long as it meets the above properties, as well as the usual desiderata applying to hash functions (easy to compute, hard to invert, hard to find collisions, etc).\n\nPredicated on the assumption that a perfect hash function exists, we can now define the problem PERFECT HASHCASH as follows: PERFECT HASHCASH takes as input a perfect hash function $H$, a natural number $n$, and the zero vector $0^d$ of length $d$, which can be thought of as a unary representation of $d$. A solution to PERFECT HASHCASH consists of an $n$ and $d$ such that $H(n)$ starts with $0^d$.\n\nGiven those inputs, it is clear that PERFECT HASHCASH is in the complexity class TFNP, since this is a function problem and a solution is guaranteed to exist.\n\nCan we also identify PERFECT HASHCASH as a member of any complexity class finer than TFNP?\n\nCould it perhaps be in PPP? PPA? PPAD? Something else?\n\nFor background, see Complexity class on Wikipedia.\n # of connections: 1","In Drupal 7, you can put the following code in template.php to add the class 'vr-paragraphs' to the field called 'field_title'\n\nfunction THEMENAME_form_alter(&amp;$form, &amp;$form_state, $form_id) {\n       $form['field_title']['#attributes']['class'][] = 'vr-paragraphs';\n}\n\n\nHow can I modify this code to target all fields on the form and not just 'field_title'.\n\nAlso, this code only adds the class to the form-wrapper part of the filed.

Even the final part checking for numbers from 100 to 999 seems to follow the same pattern. Alas, I've tried paring it down but I've honestly hit a roadblock on this one insofar as trying to come up with a creative and clean solution.\nMy second function, thousandUp is quite the disaster. I tried coming up with a looping function that creates a list of one to three-digit numbers, so that I can call subThousand on each of them from the front to the back (hence the arrZero[::-1]. At the same time, after converting each element in the list to a word, I concatenate it with the appropriate equivalent in the zGroup list, or the list of the \"zero-groups\". However, I personally can't find a safer and more precise way of landing on the \"correct\" spot in the zGroup list to start concatenating.\n\nTo get around this, I took the length of the splitByThousands array, adjusted for 0-index, and used it to get the appropriate \"zero-append\" (zap). Before the loop ends, I subtract one from its current value so that it's adjusted accordingly.\nIn addition, as I'm attempting to make the output as clean as possible, I add a \" \" to the wrd variable so it doesn't concatenate poorly with the zero-append, as well as add a \", \" to the zero-append to separate it from the next zero-group. However, there will be instances that there are no values for some zero-groups. To avoid showing stuff like zero million, I added a check inside. This is the part that makes me die a little inside:\n\nfor z in arrZero[::-1]:\n    wrd = subThousand(str(z)) + \" \"\n    zap = zGroup[lenArr] + \", \"\n    if wrd == \" \":\n        break\n    elif wrd == \"zero \":\n         wrd, zap = \"\", \"\"\n    resArr.append(wrd + zap)\n    lenArr -= 1\n\n\n\nIt works, but it just doesn't look good. Is it possible to do this in list-comprehension form or a better for-loop without turning it into more confusing mush?\n\nI must admit as well that the last part of the code sucks a little. I've done a lot of str--&gt;int conversions inside the functions, then I did one more outside of them. On top of that, my approach to negative numbers is hackish at best (print \"Minus\").\n # of connections: 1","I need to update a table based on another table, so I have the statement:\n\nupdate FAULTS\nset FAULTS.FAULT_STATE = (\n    select INCIDENTS.TICKET_STATE from INCIDENTS\n    where INCIDENTS.CF_ID = FAULTS.CF_ID\n)\n\n\nAnd it gives me error saying: \n\nORA-01427: single-row subquery returns more than one row\n\n\nI tried DISTINCT but the state values are different too so DISTINCT does not work.

When I developed the reports, I used a direct Oracle server connection (server address, username/password, SID, port, etc.) and the report worked perfectly. As a limit on our LMS, we're told that we must use ODBC connections instead of a direct Oracle Server connection, but, when I connect the Crystal Report to the Stored Procedure in this manner, I get a persistent Error 42000:[Oracle][ODBC] Syntax Error or Access Violation error.\n\nWe have double-checked the drivers and we're up to date. We have verified there are no actual syntax errors in the code. We have verified the username we're logging in as has the correct privileges to run the Oracle Stored Procedure. We've verified that, when supplied with the correct parameters, the Stored Procedure runs.\n\nWhat I'm seeing that I cannot explain is this.

Why? Because my feeling is that up-votes happen more often than down-votes (because something not interesting is not worth wasting a click on) and the primary action on mobile should be on the left.\n\nBut that got me thinking. I'm a lefty, so when I hold my phone (in my left hand) it's easier to reach the control on the left, hence my thought to put the primary control on the left side. But for a righty, it would be easier to reach the right-sided control.\n\nThis may be a trivial example, but if you have a UI that requires a lot of tap-based input it could make quite a difference on which side the most-used action is located.\n\nMy question: should you optimize mobile experiences based on individual handedness?

This schema can also be modified at any time. This application will be installed at the customer location, and will need to function even when they change their field structure.\n\nIn order to insert or update a record, I first call their Project.GetSchema() method, which returns the XSD file based on the current set of fields, and then I can call the Project.AddProject() method, passing in an XML file containing the project data.\n\nMy question is: What's the best way to generate the XML from the XSD file at runtime?

How I will be making the decision and setting the different gains is for another topic for now.  I am only interested in the scaling and offsetting at the moment.\n\nSo far I have come up with this circuit:\n\n\n\nWhich appears to do just what I want for the +/- 250V range.  I don't know how \"safe\" this circuit is, and if I am endangering any of the components with the 250V or not.  The graphs at the bottom are (left to right) the input voltage, the power consumption of the bottom 10M resistor, the voltage across the 100M resistor (which is simulating the Arduino ADC input) and the power consumption of the upper 10M resistor.\n\nNow, if I drop the input voltage to just +/- 2.5V and tweak the op-amp feedback resistor accordingly, for some reason the offset voltage the op-amp is adding jumps right up.  I don't know for sure if this is the fault of the simulator I am using, or if it is really what will happen, as I haven't yet breadboarded this circuit (I guess that's the next stage).\n\nThis is the output from the 2.5V version:\n\n\n\nYou can see how the offset has jumped up and the output is clipping massively.\n\nIf I drop the lower 10K resistor to the virtual ground offset voltage divider to just 3.3K it compensates, but that's not nice - I would like to just vary the one resistor.  \n\nThe op-amp is (will be) a 5V single supply rail-to-rail I/O one.\n\nThe two diodes are to protect the input of the op-amp against over voltage - I don't know if this circuit strictly needs them, but I guess it doesn't hurt to have them there.\n\nAlso, I don't know if the resistor values are quite what I want - I chose them to keep the power consumption right down and the impedance right up.  I don't want them to impact the frequency response of the circuit more than I can help - the input waveform could be anything from DC up to around 500KHz or so, and I need that reproducing at the ADC end as faithfully as I can.  (I know the Arduino can only really sample at lower speeds than that, but the Arduino is just for experimenting - the final system will use a dsPIC with 1.1Msps ADC).\n\nSo, what can I do to A) get a more stable offset, B) allow the varying of the input sensitivity without nuking either the op-amp or the ADC, and C) make the circuit safe to connect to, for example, a European mains voltage?\n # of connections: 1","I have the following tables:\n\nmembers:\n----------------------------------------------\n| member_id | member_name | member_join_date |\n----------------------------------------------  \n\nevents:\n-------------------------\n| event_id | event_name |\n-------------------------\n\nevent_dates:\n--------------------------------------\n| ev
